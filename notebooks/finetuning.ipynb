      "{\"prompt\": \"What does it mean to have a mental illness?\", \"completion\": \"Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person's thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Who does mental illness affect?\", \"completion\": \"It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition. Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child's mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs).\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"What should I know before starting a new medication?\", \"completion\": \"The best source of information regarding medications is the physician prescribing them.

How is the medication taken and for how long? What food, drinks, other medicines, and activities should be avoided while taking this medication? 4.

Are there other medications that might be appropriate? 8. If so, why do you prefer the one you have chosen? 9. How do you monitor medications and what symptoms indicate that they should be raised, lowered, or changed? 10. All medications should be taken as directed.

Many psychiatric medications begin to have a beneficial effect only after they have been taken for several weeks.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"If I feel better after taking medication, does this mean I am \\\"cured\\\" and can stop taking it?\", \"completion\": \"It is not uncommon for people to stop taking their medication when they feel their symptoms are under control. Others may choose to stop taking their medication because of its side effects, without realizing that most side effects can be effectively managed. While it may seem reasonable to stop taking the medication, the problem is that most often, the symptoms will return. If you or your child is taking medication, it is very important that you work together with your doctor before making decisions about any changes in your treatment.\\\\nAnother problem with stopping medication, particularly for stopping it abruptly, is that you may develop withdrawal symptoms that can be very unpleasant. If you and your doctor feel a trial off your medicine is a good idea, it is necessary to slowly decrease the dosage of medications so that these symptoms don\\u2019t occur.\\\\nIt is important that your doctor and pharmacist work together to make sure your medications are working safely and effectively. You should talk with them about how you are doing and if there are side effects that make you unwilling to continue treatment. They will work with you to develop strategies for minimizing these side effects, or will create a plan for switching to a different treatment that will be a better fit.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"How can I get help paying for my medication?\", \"completion\": \"Some pharmaceutical companies offer prescription assistance programs to individuals and families with financial needs, while others offer special drug discount cards.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Why do I need to keep informed?\", \"completion\": \"It may be tempting to try to block out the world altogether to avoid bad news, but it's important to keep yourself informed. We all have to step up during a pandemic because we all have a part to play in reducing the spread of the virus. It's important that you know what must be done and how you should do it. This is important for the health of your neighbours and your own mental health, and taking action can help counter difficult feelings like hopelessness and despair.   One study from people in China found that people who had reliable up-to-date information about the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness and accurate instructions on how they should act (such as instructions around hand-washing and wearing a mask) felt more resilient and felt better able to handle the virus. People who received good, accurate information reported lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This research is available for free at www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/5/1729.   Of course, it's okay to set limits. Staying informed does not mean that you have to follow the news all day. Check in a few times a day, sticking to trusted sources and media outlets. While social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, social media can also amplify bad advice, vague or untrue stories, and other unhelpful information. Be sure to use good critical thinking skills.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"How can I tell if health information is good or bad?\", \"completion\": \"Anyone can post anything online. It's up to the readers to think critically about information to decide if it seems helpful, truthful, or safe. Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn't pass the test.   It's so easy to spread information online, and we can't assume that the source we're reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it's a reliable source.   Reliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), Government of Canada ministries and agencies like Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Government of BC ministries and agencies like the BC Ministry of Health, and the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information.   Headlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more.   Websites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don't list the author or don't tell you much about themselves. Double-check the author and the credentials of any 'experts' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed.   Can you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, like research journals?   Unhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like \\\"Skyrocketing rates of infection\\\" are sensational and they're meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand, factual statements like \\\"We have 50 new cases in BC\\\" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered.   Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service?   Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice physical distancing or self-isolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community.   Like any other source of information, it's important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You'll see both very poor-quality sources next to good-quality sources, and it's up to you to decide which is which. In addition, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Why do I need a plan?\", \"completion\": \"There are a lot of things you can't control. You can't control what happens next, how governments respond, or how your neighbours react to the pandemic. What you can do is make a plan and decide how you'll manage the things you do control, like your ability to stay safe, follow public health measures, stay connected with loved ones, and take care of your mental and physical health.   Events like a pandemic change a lot over time, and that uncertainty can add to fear and stress. The truth is that we don't know what will happen next\\u2014but that doesn't mean we're all helpless. You can do a lot. You can:   Map out a daily schedule, including times you can connect with loved ones online or by phone   Plan out daily tasks and goals   Give yourself a schedule to look up current information   Make sure you have 14 days of healthy food and household supplies at home   Keep medications on hand and talk to your doctor for advice if you're at increased risk   Educate yourself on public health measures and figure out how you'll follow those instructions   Figure out how you'll manage increased childcare demands, working for home, or other changes to your usual routine   Determine if you'll need financial supports like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or BC Temporary Rent Supplement if your job is affected by COVID-19. If you anticipate a need, you can find application instructions and gather any documents or other pieces of information ahead of time   Figure out how you'll manage times when you feel overwhelmed or hopeless, like calming activities, the number for a local support or crisis line, a video chat with a loved one, or a way to connect with your mental health care provider   Look for local support organizations, neighbourhood groups, or mutual aid groups if you need extra help or support or would like to help others in your community   Some planning will be straightforward, but you may also encounter situations or times when it's harder to see a solution or good plan of action. This is a great time to practice problem-solving skills. Problem-solving is a method that helps you break down a complicated situation into manageable pieces, look for realistic and unbiased information, brainstorm possible solutions, and test the solutions that you think might work well. Problem-solving is a helpful skill no matter what else is going on in the world, and it's an empowering, methodical approach when you might otherwise feel overwhelmed or lost.

      "{\"prompt\": \"How can I maintain social connections? What if I feel lonely?\", \"completion\": \"A lot of people are alone right now, but we don't have to be lonely. We're all in this together.   While you may be physically separated from friends, family members, and other loved ones, it has never been more important to maintain those social connections. Social connections are an opportunity to seek and share support, talk through difficult feelings, share a laugh, keep up-to-date with loved ones, and help each other cope. This pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own. While measures like physical distancing and self-isolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus, the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear.   Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week.   Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help.   The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution.   Everyone feels lonely at times\\u2014maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now.   Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks.   Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support.   Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone. To find community services in BC, call or text 211 or visit www.bc211.ca.

      "{\"prompt\": \"How can I take care of my physical health?\", \"completion\": \"Taking care of your physical health is also good for your mental health. It's more important than ever to keep yourself healthy.   Try to eat as well as you can. It may be easier to reach for unhealthier comfort foods and snacks while you spend more time at home, but try to keep a balanced approach. When you stock up on groceries, don\\u2019t ignore fresh fruit and vegetables\\u2014we still have everything we need to prepare food. Now that we're advised to limit the amount of time we spend in public spaces like grocery stores, this is a great time to try out new fruits and vegetables that keep at home for longer periods of time.   If it's safer for you to stay home or you are in self-isolation, reach out for help. Many grocery stores and meal prep services offer safe, no-contact delivery. You can also ask family or friends to bring you groceries, or look for local COVID-19 support groups on social media. It's safest if others leave food and other supplies outside of your door to avoid spreading the virus.   Exercise is an important part of mental health and well-being, stress management, and health sleep. However, it's something that many people give up when they start to feel stressed or overwhelmed.   If it's safe for you to do so, spend time outside. You should still avoid busy areas or groups and stay at least two metres away from others, but there is no reason to avoid walks, runs, or other safe outdoor activities. (Note that some municipalities, BC Parks, and Parks Canada have restricted some outdoor spaces to reduce crowds, so check the status of your local parks or trails and respect closures\\u2014they're just keeping everyone safe.)   If you prefer to exercise indoors, you can also find many different exercises classes online. You can try yoga, follow a barre class, work on your cardio, pick up a new dumbbell routine, and keep up with Crossfit WODs from the comfort of your living room. Look for no-equipment exercise routines or classes if you don't already have equipment.   Poor sleep can make even simple problems feel a lot worse than they really are. Poor sleep can affect your mood, your outlook, and your patience. Unfortunately, stress and anxiety can really take a toll on your sleep. If you're having a hard time sleeping, be proactive and practice healthy sleep habits. For more, check out Wellness Module 6: Getting a Good Night's Sleep at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-6-getting-a-good-nights-sleep.   If you have other health problems like a chronic illness, check in with your doctor or health care team to see if you need to take any additional measures or precautions. Remember to plan ahead and do what you can to keep prescription or over-the-counter medications, medical supplies, supplements, or other health needs on hand.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"How can I use distraction to manage difficult thoughts or feelings?\", \"completion\": \"Distraction is a very valid tool to help you cope when everything feels overwhelming or when you feel lonely or isolated.   If you don't have a lot of energy or focus right now, try low-effort distractions like watching TV, browsing Youtube, listening to a podcast or audiobook, playing a game on your phone, reading an easy book or magazine, or working on a simple art project.   If you have more energy and focus, give yourself a to-do list every day: you can clean and take care of projects around your home, work on hobbies, connect with family or friends, read a new book and catch up on your favourite TV shows. You can find interesting opportunities to take online courses from universities all over the world through MOOCs and other online learning platforms, you can learn a new language online or through apps, and you can learn new hobbies and activities. As more people have to practice social distancing or self-isolation, people are finding creative ways to bring the world into their homes: you can tour museums and art galleries, Skype with a scientist, watch animals at zoos and nature preserves, and more.   When normal schedules are disrupted, it's easy to fall into unhelpful habits. Look for ways to keep yourself on track with healthier habits. You could set yourself goals every day or turn activities into a fun competition with friends or family\\u2014whoever takes the most language classes wins!   Many communities are using social media platforms like Facebook to organize support and help for neighbours. If you are healthy and it's safe to do so, you can sign up to walk dogs, pick up groceries and household supplies, and help others who can't go out at the moment. This can be a great way to make new connections in your area, and helping others is good for your own mental health. Just be sure to follow good hygiene practices and physical distancing\\u2014your own health is important.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"How can I reframe the situation and find more balanced perspectives?\", \"completion\": \"How you think about something impacts your feelings and your behaviours.   When we feel stressed out, angry, or fearful, it's hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have. (Remember: we all control our own actions and reactions, no matter what's going on in the world. We can call do something about this pandemic.)   People often overestimate the negative parts\\u2014their own feelings, their own abilities to manage a difficult situation, or the situation itself\\u2014and underestimate positive parts\\u2014their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones, their support networks, and opportunities.   How does the thought \\\"We're never going to make it through this!\\\" make you feel? It likely doesn't feel good\\u2014and it isn't even true.   Challenging negative, unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood, validate your ability to get through this, and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well.   Stop and notice thoughts that come up. How do they make you feel? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation?   Here are a few example:   \\\"I'm so mad that my event was cancelled! This sucks!\\\"   \\\"I know this is the safer option for everyone. When it's rescheduled, I'll enjoy it more because I won't have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness.\\\"   \\\"I hate spending so much time at home. This is so boring.\\\"   \\\"I'm doing my part to keep my neighbours safe. It's worth it because it keeps people healthy.\\\"   \\\"I'm having a hard time getting used to my new schedule. This is so frustrating.\\\"   \\\"I'll get used to this soon, just like I adapted the last time I had to change my schedule. Now that I'm home more, I'll have more time to finish the projects I haven't touched in months and I'm excited to see the end results.   \\\"I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. I feel so overwhelmed right now.\\\"   \\\"It makes sense that I feel scared\\u2014people are getting sick and we don't know when things will go back to normal. But there are a lot of things I can do to keep healthy, and I'm going to do some research so I can do my best. When I focus on the things I can do, everything feels more manageable.\\\"   \\\"We're going to be stuck inside forever. I'm already sick of this.\\\"   \\\"I understand that it will take some time to manage COVID-19, and I trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can. I know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal.\\\"   The goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that there's a problem. Instead, this exercise can help you understand the situation more realistically and see the parts that you can control right now.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"How can I challenge thinking traps?\", \"completion\": \"What you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do. Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects\\u2014this is normal and expected. However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. You're also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term.   These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You're most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You're also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you're not taking good care of yourself, like when you're not eating or sleeping well.   Here are some common thinking traps:   Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like \\\"always\\\" or \\\"never.\\\"   I was really looking forward to that concert, and now it\\u2019s cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things!   Seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure.   I wanted to eat healthier, but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure!   Saying only negative things about yourself or other people.   I made a mistake. I'm stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk!   Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence.   I've been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks, but I just know that I'm going to get sick.   Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive.   I know there's a lot I can do at home, but I'm just so sick of this. Everything is terrible.   Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation.   I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better.   Telling yourself how you \\\"should\\\" or \\\"must\\\" act.   I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying!   Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca.   Don't try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way.   This doesn't let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind.   Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens:   What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on.   What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself?   What are your emotions? How do you feel?   What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope?   Take a look at the thoughts you've listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It's common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation.   The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you've collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that:   Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, \\\"I can't do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!\\\" When this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, \\\"Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought?\\\" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn't support the idea that you're a bad employee.   Ask yourself, \\\"Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people?\\\" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism.   Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, \\\"Good parents wouldn't have this kind of problem.\\\" To challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they've ever had any problems with their kids.   Test your beliefs in person. For example, if you think that your friends don't care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you.   Once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let's use the following example:   I feel sad and overwhelmed. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do.   I'm the worst! I should be able to handle this!   Labeling   'Should' statements   Examine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I'm worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I've successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so I know I can do this.   It's okay to feel upset right now\\u2014there's a lot going on. I'm going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I'm trying to do a lot on my own, so I'm going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together.

      "{\"prompt\": \"How can I manage grief?\", \"completion\": \"While a lot of people think of grief in terms of losing a person or pet, grief can come up whenever you lose something important. This includes:   Losing security, like losing your job or wondering how long you'll be able to pay rent   Losing stability or routine, like finding yourself working from home or navigating childcare closures   Losing your sense of safety, like fearing you or someone you love might end up with COVID-19   Losing your social relationships, like missing time with family and friends now that everyone must practice physical distancing or self-isolation   Losing hope for the future, like feeling that life will never go back to normal   Losing important goals, like finding your classes, sports competitions, or performances are cancelled for the foreseeable future   Losing important milestone celebrations like graduation ceremonies and weddings   Grief bring up complicated feelings. You might feel sad, angry, frustrated, fearful, or hopeless. You may have a hard time eating or sleeping, or feel very tense. You may feel overwhelmed and tired. You may wonder if life will ever feel normal again.   Everyone grieves in their own way and their own time. Here are some strategies to try as you navigate your own journey.   Acknowledge and express your feelings in a healthy way. Give your feelings a name and find healthy ways to express them, such as by talking with a friend, writing in a journal, or making art.   Give yourself as much time as you need. Grief follows its own schedule. Give yourself permission to use this time to take care of your well-being. Let go of expectations, tasks, or other obligations that can wait.   Seek support. Grief can feel very isolating, even though a lot of people are experiencing some sort of loss right now. Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Look for ways to help and support each other.   Take care of yourself. Ignoring health and well-being can make difficult experiences feel worse. Eat as well as you can, try to get enough sleep, spend time outside if it's safe for you to do so, and exercise regularly. Think about self-care activities or strategies that have helped you cope with challenging situations in the past and make time for those activities.   Know that feelings of grief will pass. Grief may feel intense at times, but those feelings will become more manageable over time and will eventually pass.   Connect with a mental health professional if you're having a hard time. If you're having a hard time getting through the day, coping in unhealthy ways, or having a hard time managing difficult thoughts or feelings, it's a good idea to seek help from a professional like a psychologist or counsellor\\u2014many now offer online or phone appointments.

      "{\"prompt\": \"What's the difference between a psychiatrist and a registered psychologist?\", \"completion\": \"A psychiatrist is a medical doctor with extra training in mental health who can choose to prescribe medications. Some use psychotherapy (\\u2018talk therapies\\u2019) approaches like cognitive-behavioural therapy to treat mental health problems.

As they are specialist doctors, you will almost always need another doctor\\u2019s referral to see a psychiatrist, and fees are covered by MSP. If you have a valid BC Services or CareCard, you do not need to pay to see a psychiatrist.   A registered psychologist focuses on different talk therapy or counselling approaches to treatments, but they don\\u2019t prescribe medication. They have graduate degrees in psychology. There are two different ways to access registered psychologists: the public system and the private system. Registered psychologists in the public system work in some hospitals or schools. You may need a doctor\\u2019s referral to access the program, and costs are usually covered by MSP. However, most people need to access registered psychologists through the private system. To do this, you can contact the psychologist yourself\\u2014you do not need a referral. Costs are not covered by MSP, but they may be covered by employee health plans. A registered psychologist\\u2019s fees charged by hour vary, and some offer lower fees to people with lower incomes.   You\\u2019ve probably noticed that a lot of the differences come down to how you pay for different services and how these professionals are educated. The practical differences in how they work are not always so clear. When it comes to your treatment and care, the most important part is finding a professional who supports your own goals. Are you really focused on fine-tuning medications? Are you looking for a particular therapy approach? Does the professional\\u2019s philosophy of care make sense to you? Do you like the professional you\\u2019re talking to and do you feel safe sharing your experiences? Ultimately, your relationship with the professional is what matters.

      "{\"prompt\": \"What's the difference between psychotherapy and counselling?\", \"completion\": \"Psychotherapy and counselling have a lot in common and usually mean the same thing. Both are used to describe professionals who use talk-based approaches to help someone recover from a mental illness or mental health problem. Many different professionals may provide counselling or psychotherapy, including registered psychologists, registered clinical counsellors, psychiatrists, other therapists and counsellors, family doctors, psychiatric nurses, and faith leaders.   It\\u2019s useful to talk to someone about any problem\\u2014a lot of people find that simply talking with friends or family can help them feel better. A professional therapist or counsellor can offer more: they have training, experience, and emotional distance (since they don\\u2019t know you). They use different theories to listen to you, support you, and approach different problems or patterns. For example, a psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioural therapy is based on the theory that learning skills to change your thinking and actions can positively impact your emotions, well-being, and future thoughts and behaviours. A therapist could help you learn and practice these skills.   There are many psychotherapies with good evidence of being effective for different problems or illnesses. A few examples include cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, solutions-focused brief psychotherapy, narrative therapy, and emotion-focused therapy.   In general, some aspects of therapy and counselling are the same, no matter which approach you choose: the expectations you bring to your counselling sessions, the match between your understanding of the problems and your therapist\\u2019s understanding of the problem, and the trust and rapport that you have with your therapist. In fact, one research review found that 50% of the improvement seen in clients who just received active listening and support from a counsellor (called non-directive supportive therapy) was due simply to the relationship between client and therapist.1 Psychotherapy can and does work, but the professional you choose, and their match with your values, is also very important.   When you\\u2019re looking for a professional, it\\u2019s always a good idea to ask if they are a member of a professional organization (like those listed in the next section).\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"What's the difference between CBT and DBT?\", \"completion\": \"CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy) and DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) are two forms of psychotherapy or \\u201ctalk therapy.\\u201d In both, you work with a mental health professional to learn more about the challenges you experience and learn skills to help you manage challenges on your own.   Cognitive-behavioural therapy or CBT teaches you how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours influence each other. For example, if you believe that people don\\u2019t like you (thought), you might avoid social situations (behaviour) and feel lonely (feeling). However, CBT teaches you how to use these relationships to your advantage: a positive change in one factor (changing a thought or behaviour) can lead to positive changes in all factors. CBT is an approach that has been proven by research to work for many different mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and substance use problems.   CBT is structured, short-term, goal-oriented and focused on the present. It starts with education around the particular mental illness or challenge and how the illness or challenge affects you. Next, you\\u2019ll learn and practice skills and strategies like problem-solving or realistic thinking to help you make changes in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. You\\u2019ll learn how you can use your new skills to deal with problems in the future.   Dialectical behaviour therapy or DBT is based on CBT, with greater focus on emotional and social aspects. DBT was developed to help people cope with extreme or unstable emotions and harmful behaviours. DBT is an evidence-based approach to help people regulate emotions. It started as a treatment for borderline personality disorder, and current research shows it may help with many different mental illnesses or concerns, particularly self-harm.   Key differences between CBT and DBT are validation and relationships. DBT teaches you that your experiences are real, and it teaches you how to accept who you are, regardless of challenges or difficult experiences. Relationships are also very important in DBT\\u2014including the relationships between you and your DBT practitioner. You may have frequent check-ins to talk about any successes or problems. Treatment may include a mix of one-on-one sessions and group sessions. In addition to CBT skills, you\\u2019ll learn skills around managing your emotions, building relationships with others, coping well with problems or distress, acceptance, and mindfulness.   As with many talk therapies, it takes time and effort to enjoy the benefits of CBT and DBT skills. But once people master skills with support from your CBT or DBT therapist, they often find that their new skills and strategies become second nature\\u2014they are tools that last a lifetime.\"}\n",

They are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants don\\u2019t work. Other medications such as lithium, thyroid medication, or antipsychotics may also be prescribed, often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect. Antidepressants are not only used to treat depression\\u2014they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders.   Only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants. If your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants, keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication. It can be a frustrating process, especially when you feel unwell, but it\\u2019s important to find something that works for you! Side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people, and it\\u2019s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first.

While it can take a few weeks to really see improvements with many antidepressants, it\\u2019s still a good idea to talk to your doctor about what to expect.   Talk to the doctor that prescribed your medication if you experience symptoms or side effects that are distressing you. If you want to talk to a trusted professional about the most common side effects, call your pharmacist. You can reach a pharmacist by phone after-hours by calling 811.   It\\u2019s also best not to stop taking the medication or changing the dose on your own without first talking to a health care provider. While it might be tempting to stop taking your medication when you start feel better, it\\u2019s important to follow your doctor\\u2019s instructions.   In some cases, people can have an allergic reaction to a medication. Some reactions are not serious, like a rash. In these cases, you can call the pharmacist or call 811 to reach help after-hours. If you have a serious reaction like difficult breathing, dizziness, or confusion, call 911 right away.   When you start a new medication, your pharmacist will give you a printout with information like side effects, signs of an allergic reaction, how long it might take to work, and other information.

Remember, too, that the person you care about may have a very different idea of what\\u2019s causing their difficulties and what the negative impacts are on their life.

The good news is that mental health problems are treatable, even if you or someone you care about has experienced a brain injury. It may be helpful to find a service provider who is familiar with both brain injuries and mental health.   For more information and support, visit the BC Brain Injury Association.

How we can or should help may seem fairly obvious when a loved one experiences a physical health problem, but many people say they\\u2019re not sure how to best help when a loved one experiences a mental illness like depression. Here are some tips:   You don\\u2019t have to understand exactly what someone else is experiencing, you just need to recognize that it\\u2019s a difficult experience. You can try something like, \\u201cI can see that this experience or these symptoms are really painful for you,\\u201d or, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to hear that you\\u2019re feeling unwell.\\u201d If you have experienced depression yourself, you might say, \\u201cI know how you feel.\\u201d Just remember that everyone experiences illnesses like depression differently, and empathy is about recognizing the impact of the illness, not comparing symptoms.   You don\\u2019t have to be an expert, but learning more about depression can help you understand what\\u2019s going on (and maybe dispel some of the unhelpful myths around depression). Our Depression info sheet is a great place to start, and we have a list of resources at Q&A: Where can I learn more about depression?   Sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really help\\u2014in fact, many people who experience a mood disorder say that they just want to be heard. It\\u2019s important to understand that talking about something difficult like experiences of depression can be very hard for your loved one. You cannot force them to talk about it, but you can invite them to, and create safe and quiet spaces to talk. If a loved one opens up to you, listen actively\\u2014that is, without distractions like your phone or the TV. Really pay attention to what they have to say. Listen with empathy and without judgement. Even if you don\\u2019t understand the problem or see the problem in a different way, your main concern is the distress or difficult feelings your loved one is experiencing. You can find in-depth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once, or at all. That\\u2019s okay! Respect your loved one\\u2019s boundaries and let them tell you what they\\u2019re ready to talk about.   Even when you have the best intentions, unsolicited advice can be unhelpful. You likely can\\u2019t fix the problem, and you may not know the whole story. If you\\u2019d like to share what worked for you in a similar situation, you can ask if the other person would like to talk about strategies that worked for you.   Different people need different things\\u2014don\\u2019t assume you know what\\u2019s best! Some people need emotional help, like someone they can talk with. Other people may have a good relationship with a counsellor or other professional, but they might need practical help, like help around the house or help sticking to their treatment plan. And others may simply want to be included in some social events. By asking what a person needs, you may also be less tempted to give advice.   When people experience an episode of depression, they can have a lot of very negative thoughts and feelings. This can take a real toll on others. It\\u2019s a good idea to seek support for yourself\\u2014there are support groups just for family members and friends. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of family support groups around BC for any mental illness.   If your loved one isn\\u2019t happy with their treatment or would like to try a different option, you can also help them seek different resources or services. You can find general advice in the Ask Us section of HeretoHelp. To find local services, call the BC Mental Health Support Line at 310-6789 (no area code) or email us.   This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved one\\u2019s treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19)\\u2014but you can support them as they work towards recovery. In most cases, your loved one\\u2019s treatment and recovery plans are their choice\\u2014you are there to offer support and encouragement.   In order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be actively involved. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn\\u2019t work and will only hurt everyone involved.

Respect your loved one\\u2019s boundaries and let them tell you when they\\u2019re ready to talk.   Symptoms of schizophrenia like hallucinations (sensations that aren\\u2019t real, like hearing voices) or delusions (beliefs that can\\u2019t be true, like believing that you are being followed by a spy) can take some time to stop even when people are receiving treatment and following their treatment plan. As a group, these very distressing symptoms are called psychosis. Many people have a hard time responding to a loved one\\u2019s hallucinations or delusions. It\\u2019s best to avoid arguing about these experiences. Remember that delusion are symptoms of schizophrenia\\u2014they are not thoughts that you can talk someone out of. Telling someone that their experiences aren\\u2019t real or aren\\u2019t true doesn\\u2019t help when the experiences feel very real to that person! A better approach is to empathize with the feelings that hallucinations or delusions bring up\\u2014without confirming or denying the hallucination or delusion. For example, if a loved one is frustrated or upset when they hear voices, it isn\\u2019t helpful to say something like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re okay! It isn\\u2019t real. I don\\u2019t hear anything.\\u201d Instead, you might say, \\u201cI can only image how upsetting that voice must be. I can see the voice makes you feel scared.\\u201d Know that with good treatment and support, symptoms like hallucinations and delusions become much easier for people to manage and lose importance.   Ask how you can help. When people experience a serious mental illness like schizophrenia, they may want to plan how they can take action if they start to feel unwell again, especially if they have dependent children. These plans, such as advanced directives or Ulysses Agreements, are made when a person feels well and are meant to communicate their wishes to loved ones and their care team. Ask your loved one if they have a plan in place so you know what they need if they need help. If you\\u2019d like to learn more about planning for care, see the BC Schizophrenia Society.   If a loved one is experiencing an episode of psychosis or is recovering for an episode of psychosis, they might need extra help. For example, people who are actively experiencing hallucinations or delusions might need a lot of personal space and feel uncomfortable being around a lot of people or even making eye contact. When people are recovering from an episode of psychosis, they may need a quiet space and a lot of rest. Sometimes people can get back into their usual routines fairly quickly, while other times it may take a lot of time (and effort) to get back into routines. Keep in mind that too much help can be a bit counterproductive. It may well be faster and easier for you to take care of your loved one\\u2019s tasks or chores yourself, but rebuilding activity and confidence are a big part of recovery. Encourage and support your loved one as they take on daily responsibilities, and let them tell you when they need extra help.   Schizophrenia can be a difficult illness\\u2014for everyone. During episodes of psychosis, your loved one may experience frightening sensations that you can\\u2019t understand. They may act in ways that you don\\u2019t understand. Other symptoms of schizophrenia can make it hard for people to express emotions or feelings, communicate clearly, or seem interested in others. It\\u2019s important to know that these are symptoms of an illness. They are no one\\u2019s fault, but they can still be hard to cope with. Consider reaching out to a family and friends support group for your own support. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of groups around BC at www.bcss.org/monthly-meetings-calendar/.   As a family member, it\\u2019s important to take care of yourself. Try to maintain your regular schedule and activities, such as your exercise routine and hobbies. Ask another family member or good friend to provide help with caregiving, especially in the early days of your loved one's illness. If you need help balancing time for self-care with caregiving duties, check out the BC Schizophrenia Society\\u2019s Family Respite Program.   Try to maintain your friendships or the network of people that you have in your life. These will later become important supports as your loved one recovers. Educate them and update them on your loved one's recovery. People are sometimes afraid to ask questions about schizophrenia and this will put them at ease.   This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved one\\u2019s treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19), but you can support them. Schizophrenia can make it difficult for people to make and go to appointments and follow their treatment plan. With your loved one\\u2019s permission, you may choose to help by reminding them of appointments, taking them to appointments, or whatever helps in your situation. If your loved one isn\\u2019t happy with their treatment or would like to try a new approach, you can encourage them to talk with their care team, like their doctor or mental health team\\u2014it can be dangerous to stop or change a treatment without a doctor\\u2019s support.   Treatment can be a difficult area for loved ones. It\\u2019s hard to see someone you love in pain. You might be scared of the things your loved one is experiencing. You want to help. But in order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be active in their care. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn\\u2019t work (or if it does, in the case of an emergency, only for a short time) and can often hurt everyone involved. In most cases, anyone 19 years of age and older and not at risk of harm is free to make their own choices. And their choices may include refusing treatment or choosing a treatment that you disagree with. It helps everyone if you can be respectful and keep honest communication open between you. You can learn more about dealing with this situation in Q&A: An adult in my life seems ill and won\\u2019t find help. What can I do?.   If you think your loved one is at risk of harming themselves or others and they refuse help, it is possible to have them evaluated by a psychiatrist under the Mental Health Act. This process may involve police and other first responders, and it can be a difficult and stressful process for everyone. But it can also be a necessary step if someone is in danger. You can learn more about the Mental Health Act in the info sheet Families Coping with a Crisis and you can find the Guide to the Mental Health Act at www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2005/MentalHealthGuide.pdf.

If I\\u2019m a parent, what should I tell my young adult?\", \"completion\": \"Using cannabis has the potential for benefits and harms. Young people use cannabis, like other psychoactive drugs, to feel good, to feel better, to do better or to explore. Trying cannabis out of curiosity, as an experiment, or while socializing with friends, is related to moderate use and lower potential for harm. Using cannabis to cope with daily life, deal with unpleasant feelings, or fit in with a social group has higher potential for harm. This is because dealing with these kinds of issues is associated with frequent and heavier use, less thought about potential harms and little consideration of alternatives for coping such as talking with a parent or trusted adult or physical activity with friends.   Evidence suggests that the younger a person is when they start using cannabis and the more often they use, the greater the potential for harms. The legal age to use cannabis in BC is 19. However, our brains do not finish developing until about age 25. Delaying cannabis use until early adulthood may reduce potential harmful effects on the brain.   Some young people, especially those with many factors predisposing them to serious and persistent mental health issues, should probably not use cannabis. Cannabis has been associated with an increased risk for psychosis and schizophrenia in this small group of people. Some people with serious mental health issues have also reported that using cannabis has helped them cope with their illness by helping them feel less anxious or stressed. As in most situations, balancing potential benefits and harms of using cannabis will be key for young people who have serious mental health concerns.   Mixing drugs, such as cannabis and alcohol, can also increase the possibility of experiencing harms. Intoxication may be more intense and long lasting and the young person may not appreciate how impaired they are. We often suggest, \\u201cNot too much, not too often, and only in a safe context\\u201d as a simple way to gauge your use of any psychoactive substance.   As a parent or caring adult, an open respectful relationship with a young person is one of your best resources and ways to prevent harms from substance use. Letting the youth know they can approach you at any time to talk about cannabis, other substances, or anything else of concern to them, says they matter to you and you are ready to listen and engage in dialogue with them. This is a great place to begin addressing anything that might come the young person\\u2019s way in life!   The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says, \\u201cThere is no health without mental health.\\u201d In the course of a lifetime, not all people will experience a mental illness, but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental well-being (i.e., their mental health) just like we all have challenges with our physical well-being from time to time.   When we talk about mental health, we\\u2019re talking about our mental well-being: our emotions, our thoughts and feelings, our ability to solve problems and overcome difficulties, our social connections, and our understanding of the world around us.   A mental illness is an illness the affects that way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses, and they have different symptoms that impact peoples\\u2019 lives in different ways.   Health isn\\u2019t like an on/off switch. There are different degrees of health. People move on a continuum ranging from great or good health to so-so health to poor health to illness or disability. For example, some people have good health and have no problems going about their lives. Some people experience serious health problems, and their poor health has a very negative impact on their life. Some people have serious health problems that last for a long time, and others have serious health problems that resolve very quickly. Many people fall somewhere in the middle\\u2014they\\u2019re generally in good health, though the occasional problem may come up. Mental health is the same way.   Just as someone who feels unwell may not have a serious illness, people may have poor mental health without a mental illness. We all have days where we feel a bit down, or stressed out, or overwhelmed by something that\\u2019s happening in our lives. An important part of good mental health is the ability to look at problems or concerns realistically. Good mental health isn\\u2019t about feeling happy and confident 100% of time and ignoring any problems. It\\u2019s about living and coping well despite problems.   Just as it\\u2019s possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness, it\\u2019s entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness. That\\u2019s because mental illnesses (like other health problems) are often episodic, meaning there are times (\\u2018episodes\\u2019) of ill health and times of better or good health.   With the right supports and tools, anyone can live well\\u2014however they define well\\u2014and find meaning, contribute to their communities, and work towards their goals.\"}\n",

(Scientists call this the \\u2018fight, flight, or freeze\\u2019 response.)   A manageable amount of anxiety from time to time can be helpful. For example, it can motivate you to prepare for a test a school or finish a task at work. Even happy events like moving to a new home or celebrating an important milestone can bring up anxiety\\u2014all of this is just part of being human.   Anxiety is a problem when it becomes overwhelming or unmanageable and it comes up unexpectedly. Anxiety disorders are mental illnesses that have a big impact your life. People may avoid going about their daily lives in order to avoid anxiety. They may experience a lot of uncomfortable physical sensations and physical health problems. Many people say that they know their anxiety isn\\u2019t based in reality, but they feel \\u2018trapped\\u2019 by their thought and feelings. Anxiety disorders can be treated.

The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we\\u2019re finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we\\u2019re stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over.   Anxiety, on the other hand, isn\\u2019t always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself.

Schizoid personality disorder or SPD affects social interactions and relationships. People with SPD may have a hard time relating to others and showing emotions. They may avoid close relationships and prefer to spend their time alone, seeming distant even to close family members. Many people don\\u2019t respond to strong emotions like anger, even when others try to provoke them. On the outside, people with SPD may seem cold or aloof, showing little emotion.   While they have a similar name, schizoid personality disorder isn\\u2019t the same as schizophrenia.   Schizoid personality disorder is believed to be relatively uncommon. While some people with SPD may see it as part of who they are, other people may feel a lot of distress, especially around social interactions.

      "{\"prompt\": \"What is antisocial personality disorder?\", \"completion\": \"A personality disorder is a pattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviours that last for a long time and causes some sort of problem or distress.   Antisocial personality disorder or ASPD affects the way people think about the rights of others. Someone with ASPD may disregard laws or expectations, lack remorse when they hurt others or break the law, make reckless decisions, and believe they are superior to others. People may see someone with ASPD as overly dramatic, impulsive, manipulative, and deceitful. Some people may appear charming, at least on the surface. Like all mental illnesses, antisocial personality disorder is a spectrum. Some people may only occasionally act out, while others may break the law often and spend a lot of time in the criminal justice system.   ASPD is only diagnosed in adults, but people with ASPD start to have problems with conduct or antisocial behaviours at a young age. They may be diagnosed with conduct disorder during childhood.   Treatment for antisocial personality disorder, usually psychotherapy, can help reduce the harms of ASPD and help people build empathy towards others. ASPD is treatable and it may improve as a person approaches middle age.   All of us have hurt someone else or acted without thinking of others' needed. It\\u2019s important to remember that antisocial personality disorder is an enduring pattern around lack of empathy and lack of remorse.

This happens at the expense of other important things in life, including relationships with others. Work can take priority over every other part of life, too, and people with OCPD may seem excessively dedicated, but may be unable to complete tasks due to perfectionism.

While obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have a similar name, they are not the same illness. People with obsessive-compulsive disorder usually understand that their obsessions and compulsions are illogical and usually experience a lot of distress, even though they may not be able to stop obsessions or compulsions. Compulsions are an attempt to reduce anxiety, not to find pleasure.

Dissociative identity disorder, on the other hand, does cause a split or fragmented understanding of a person\\u2019s sense of themselves.   Dissociative identity disorder is really more about fragmented identities than many different personalities that develop on their own. Most people see different parts of their being as part of the whole person. For people who experience DID, identity fragments may have very different characteristics, including their own history, identity, and mannerisms. A key part of DID is dissociation\\u2014feeling detached to the world around you. People who experience DID may have many unexplainable gaps in their memory, forget information they\\u2019re already learned, or have difficulties recalling things they\\u2019ve said or done. Unlike portrayals of DID on TV or in movies, DID may not be obvious to others, and it can take a lot of time to come to the diagnosis.

Hallucinations are sensations that are not real, such as hearing voices or sounds that aren\\u2019t real. Hearing voices is a common hallucination, but hallucinations can be experiences with any sense\\u2014hearing, sight, smell, taste, or touch. Delusions are strong beliefs that can\\u2019t possibly be true. Common delusions include the belief that someone is following or monitoring you, or the belief that you have extraordinary powers or abilities. Other symptoms of psychosis include difficulties concentrating, completing tasks, or making decisions. Thoughts may feel \\u2018jumbled\\u2019 or confused. Some people have a hard time following conversations or speaking clearly. Psychosis can even affect the way people move or express their emotions.   Schizophrenia is a mental illness that causes psychosis, but schizophrenia also has other symptoms. And it isn\\u2019t the only cause of psychosis. In some cases, other mental illnesses cause psychosis, including depression, bipolar disorder, dementia and borderline personality disorder. Psychosis may come up during times of extreme stress, a major lack of sleep, or trauma. People who are using or withdrawing from certain drugs or medications may experience psychosis. Psychosis may also be caused by a brain injury, neurological problem, or other health problem. So while psychosis can be a part of schizophrenia, it can be caused by many other things too.

      "{\"prompt\": \"What\\u2019s the difference between substance use and addiction?\", \"completion\": \"People tend to use the word \\u201caddiction\\u201d to mean very different things. \\u201cI am addicted to shopping\\u201d might mean only that the speaker likes to shop. On the other hand, \\u201cHe is addicted\\u201d might mean the speaker thinks the other person is completely unable to control his own behaviour. When people use the word about psychoactive (mind-altering) substances like alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs, they often assume these drugs are dangerous and have the power to control human behaviour.   The evidence, however, suggests a quite different picture. While substance use can clearly contribute to health and social problems, substances can be beneficial for some people in some situations. Many people celebrate a special occasion with a nice glass of wine, for example. Some people use tobacco as a powerful symbol in cultural and spiritual ceremonies. In fact, substances have been used by humans throughout history for many reasons: to feel good, to feel better, to improve performance, for cultural/spiritual reasons, and to have new experiences.   Substance use is more complicated than just \\u201cgood\\u201d or \\u201cbad.\\u201d It\\u2019s helpful to think of substance use along a continuum, from beneficial use to harmful use. Along the middle of the continuum, substance use may be both beneficial and harmful. You have an enjoyable night out with friends, but feel a little ill the next day. At the far end of the continuum, some people develop dependence\\u2014they need to continually use the drug in order to feel normal and will keep using even when that leads to financial difficulties, problems at home or at work, health problems, or legal problems.   In general, substance use is a problem when it causes problems for you or others\\u2014and how much use causes problems will be different for different people in different situations. The reason a person uses a substance influences the risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses a substance to have fun, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person uses a substance to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow. Managing our risk involves being aware of why we are using and what impacts our use is having on ourselves and those around us.

      "{\"prompt\": \"How do I know if I'm drinking too much?\", \"completion\": \"Sorting out if you are drinking too much can be complicated. You are unique and your relationship with alcohol is unique. No one has the same combination of life experiences and influences that you do. So even though you and your friend may choose to drink, how and why you use alcohol may be different.   Those of us who drink, seek benefits from alcohol, not difficulties. But sometimes we start using more, and more often, than makes sense. As a general rule, drinking alcohol becomes a problem when it negatively affects our life or the lives of others.

You can get personalized feedback related to your pattern of drinking as compared to Canada\\u2019s Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines via the Alcohol Reality Check screening app. This short, simple screen can be used by people of all ages.   All alcohol use involves some risk. The reasons people use alcohol can influence their risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses alcohol to enhance special celebrations, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person drinks to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow.   By reflecting on your pattern of drinking you can manage your risk for immediate injury or death, your chances for long-term health consequences such as cancer or heart disease, and your risk of developing habitual patterns of drinking that may lead to these harms.   Whenever you decide to drink alcohol, it is helpful to know what steps you can take to ensure that your drinking behaviour is the most rewarding and least harmful possible. The following are some useful guidelines to consider.   Not too much. Managing how much you drink on a given occasion helps decrease risky behaviours.   Tip: Drink slowly and alternate between non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages.   Not too often. Drinking in moderation helps to reduce harms to ourselves and others over time.   Tip: Keep less alcohol at home and set limits on how much you are going to drink each week, avoiding drinking on some days.   Only in safe contexts. Making informed decisions about where you drink helps to minimize alcohol-related harm.

      "{\"prompt\": \"If cannabis is dangerous, why are we legalizing it?\", \"completion\": \"Cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol.   Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17, 2018. Adults (over age 19 in BC) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality.   When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic.   The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm.

      "{\"prompt\": \"How can I convince my kids not to use drugs?\", \"completion\": \"You can't. But you can influence their capacity to make good choices in a world where alcohol and other drugs are available. It's about helping your child develop the skills to assess what might be helpful in achieving their goals in life. It's also about nourishing a supportive relationship, so they know where to go with questions or problems.   Opening up a discussion about drugs can help strengthen your relationship with your child. Inviting and allowing open, honest conversation about drugs (or any other subject) makes your child know that what they are thinking, feeling and experiencing matters to you. The goal is to get your child talking and sharing their thoughts and feelings.   When young people are asked thoughtful, open-ended questions exploring what they think, it helps them become interested in their own thoughts and behaviour. This process of self-reflection is part of developing critical thinking skills, a part of good decision-making. Critical thinking skills are actually an essential part of reducing the risks related to using drugs. Once young people have considered something carefully, they are a lot less likely to act out of impulse or in response to influence.   There is no rule about how or where a conversation about alcohol or other drugs should start. Even young children know drugs are a part of our culture. They see people drinking around them and are exposed to drugs on TV and in advertising. This makes it a subject that can be brought up naturally while getting ready for a family celebration where alcohol will be present, or if you are planning to visit a relative who uses tobacco, or while swapping stories at the dinner table about what happened at work and school that day.   Talking with teens and young adults about drugs as they make choices on the path into adulthood helps them to develop personal standards, minimize risks and critically assess popular beliefs about drug use. This can be particularly important as they transition to the legal age for using alcohol or cannabis and move out of the family home. While young adults have more independence and more legal rights, parents can continue to be an important sounding board on which to try out their thoughts and ideas.

      "{\"prompt\": \"What is the legal status (and evidence) of CBD oil?\", \"completion\": \"Cannabidiol or CBD is a naturally occurring component of cannabis. It is extracted from the cannabis plant and often made into an oil for use. CBD is not psychoactive, and does not produce the \\u2018high\\u2019 of THC (tetrahyrocannabinol), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. CBD is legal in Canada and has been used in the treatment of various medical conditions.   All cannabinoids, including CBD, produce effects in the body by attaching to certain receptors in the brain or immune system. The human body also produces its own cannabinoids. It seems that CBD does not attach directly to receptors. Instead, it directs the body to use more of its own cannabinoids to produce the therapeutic effects associated with CBD.   Research suggests that CBD may provide relief for chronic pain. Sativex is a proprietary medication that combines THC and CBD and may be prescribed for the relief of pain associated with multiple sclerosis. There is also some evidence suggesting that CBD may be a promising support for people with opioid use disorders. The researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders including anxiety, mood-related symptoms, pain, and insomnia.   After researching the safety and effectiveness of CBD oil for treating epilepsy, in 2018, the United States FDA approved CBD (Epidiolex) as a therapy for two rare conditions characterized by epileptic seizures. Other evidence suggests that CBD may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, though further research is needed before introducing CBD into medical practice.   There is some initial evidence that CBD may help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease keep the ability to recognize the faces of people that they know, and thus slow progression of the illness. Again, more research is needed in this area.   Because of the way cannabis and its products are metabolized, scientists believe there is a potential for interaction with other drugs, although nothing significant has yet been recorded. CBD has been found to be generally safe. Reports from patients indicate that negative drug interactions are not common. As with any other treatment, it is important to monitor your use of CBD and seek assistance if you experience any problems or have questions or concerns about its use.

      "{\"prompt\": \"What is the evidence on vaping?\", \"completion\": \"\\\"Vaping\\\" is the term for using a device where liquids, often flavoured, are turned into vapour (hence, vaping) and inhaled. A vaping device consists of a mouthpiece, tank or reservoir to hold the liquid, a heating element and a battery to power the element. The liquid is heated to become a mist, inhaled through the mouth into the lungs where the nicotine or cannabis enters the bloodstream. Any residual vapour is exhaled. Vaping devices come in several types, shapes, and sizes, referred to as e-cigarettes, vape pens, vapes, mods, tanks, or e-hookahs. Vaping liquid (e-liquid, e-juice) consists of a solvent, usually propylene glycol or glycerol, flavour, and nicotine or cannabis, though it may not contain anything. In British Columbia you must be 19 years old to buy vaping products.   The number of young people who smoke cigarettes has declined over the past few years, while vaping has increased. E-cigarettes were developed as an alternative to smoking. The first devices were available in 2003 and looked much like a traditional cigarette. Nicotine vapour contains significantly fewer toxins and other particles than smoke from cigarettes. Vaping is a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and evidence suggests, it may help some people quit smoking. Evidence suggests vaping is likely not a gateway to smoking tobacco.   Though less harmful than smoking cigarettes, vaping still carries potential harms. There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. (A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer). Some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine. E-cigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands. Other chemicals, flavourings, and heavy metals present in vaping liquids, have not as yet been well studied. Long-term health risks from vaping are thus undetermined. More research is needed in these areas.   Marketing strategies for vaping products, often on social media, are designed to appeal to young people. The range of flavours available, especially those that are fruity and sweet, and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth. Young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and 'smoke' in a less harmful way.   Making the time and space for discussion and exploring the issues around vaping is one important way we can support young people and indeed, each other, in making good decisions about if, when, or how much to vape.

      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah, I'm just been a lot of anxiety right now my oldest child is moving out. And I know as a mom that that's the goal is to, you know, let them be independent and you start on their own but still a little concerned that it's gonna work out and that you know that he's in a good place and living where he should and kind of eat dinner and do those things that you worry about him doing. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. I'll try to help you that I'm sure your your get started. Right?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Absolutely. The sooner the better.\", \"completion\": \"Good. I want to make sure I go over a few disclosures about the counseling relationship before we get into assessment, which is the first stage. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Right. We'll ask you a lot of questions. Okay, that's your past and what's going on now. And then after assessment, we'll move into counseling. So we come in roughly once a week. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"But first I want to get through kind of a piece on confidentiality.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay. So like attorneys what you what you can do and not do.\", \"completion\": \"We kind of I'm glad you brought that up, about attorneys. Attorneys and clients have confidentiality, and counselors and clients have confidentiality, but the two types are different. So I'll explain to you how it worked between you and I. But no, that is a little bit different than it works between the attorney and their client.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay. Now explain the differences to me.\", \"completion\": \"Absolutely. So, one thing about a casting lationship all this time you spend here, the notes they'll take in during the assessment and the progress notes later on. Because all of a chart with your name on it will be stored in a secure place. All that is confidential, and next to that word confidential as an astress. Right? There's exceptions. Okay. And what I want to explain to you are those exceptions to confidentiality, because confidentiality isn't absolute.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"So there's times you might tell someone else something that I said,\", \"completion\": \"Yes.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. But they're very specific situations that occur that permit that or mandate that. Okay, I want to review those with you before we move on. Okay. Does that make sense?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. I'd like to know that before I tell you.\", \"completion\": \"I agree. That's a good, good way to look at it. So the first exception to confidentiality is when you give me permission to release information that you've disclosed and interactions we've had during counseling This is actually fairly common. For example, do you have a primary care physician? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I do? Yes.\", \"completion\": \"So depending on we talk about you may want him or her to know about discussions. So you may sign a release, that gives that physician the right to talk to me directly. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"That makes sense, \", \"completion\": \"right. Furthermore, your issues with are part of your concern with your son. So say and I don't necessarily foresee this but say, later on, as we work together, you want him to come in for a session just to talk about something right? You would have to sign release confidentiality, so we could be here and talk with me. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"That makes sense?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"That makes a lot of sense.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. The other exceptions are insurance company. So when you fill out your screen packet insurance Insurance companies have access to like progress knows the assessment, anything on the chart and they're generally responsible this information I don't know of any instances where they're irresponsible with it. But I just think it's important that you know that anything I write in the chart anything in the chart itself technically the insurance company can ask for and periodically could review. Again, I've never seen in my career any difficulty with that, but as far as I know that information would be transmitted off site so to speak. And when this agency bills it would be transmitted your information be transmitted off site to the insurance company\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"so it goes automatically whatever progress made you have automatically go to the insurance company?\", \"completion\": \"the progress notes, don't for standard billing, but information about the type of session we had length of the session. any of that and some other personal information about you to identify you would go to them also they know a service was provided. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Like I said, There They're generally very responsible information, large companies that have done this for a while, right,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"taking all your medical stuff too. So they have,\", \"completion\": \"they have access to different types of data. Another exception to confidentiality and again, I don't foresee necessarily a this happening, but I want to tell you about the limits of it is in the event that I feel that you're going to harm, or there's a high potential that you're gonna harm yourself or someone else. In that instance, I'm obligated to act. Now, we're gonna probably talk about a lot of different elements of your life through the next however many weeks were together. Okay? When, and if, and again, I don't predict this. You have some sort of suicidal ideation or you want to harm smell. So in the unlikely event that happens, I would only release information I have to release to protect you or the person that I'm worried about. So if you review a lie like deep, dark secrets, and then you tell me that you want to go harm a relative of yours, right? I have a duty to warn that relative of what you plan on doing, where you are at the moment, what threats you've made, but I'm certainly not going to tell them about your deepest, darkest secrets to be revealed. Okay, unless they're directly relevant to protecting. Okay, it's very unlikely they would be,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't know why I not hurt anybody, but I should know this\", \"completion\": \"I know. Yeah, but I just want to let you know that these know this confidentiality information I release is limited to just what I need to release. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"Similarly, if you have any type of suicide ideation, and I was had to contact somebody come pick you up like law enforcement. I would only tell them I knew tell them from the get to the hospital and get you in a safe environment. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"This I want to take an opportunity Talking about the suicide ideation. So you know that just because you have suicidal ideation, like thoughts, a lot of people think about suicide from time to time, or even homicidal ideation or thoughts, you're going to harm someone by not saying kill, but it's harm does not by any means automatically me, I'm gonna call police think of it as something that opens a discussion certainly about your safety and someone else's safety. But that's not, you know, we don't go automatically from there. You know, that is, if you have a thought of suicide to the hospital. There's a discussion and many, most the vast majority, actually of people that have a suicide ideation do not have any intent or plan to commit suicide. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"So you say, so, if someone's thinking about it, you are not just gonna call the police and send you to the hospital. You're gonna try to get to the bottom of it.\", \"completion\": \"Absolutely.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. That, you know, I responsibility to make sure you're safe and I feel like I can do that. If we talk to Through an issue and you don't have any, any reason to believe you're going to harm yourself, but just had a suicidal thought, okay, okay, that's a lot different than you, you came in to me and told me about detail plan, and you really seem like you're going to do it, then I'd be a lot more worried. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay That makes sense. Okay.\", \"completion\": \"So that exception to confidentiality is really used in the most extreme cases of suicidal or homicidal ideation. Another exception in the state that will let you know about is if I have any reason to believe that a child or an elderly person is being abused. I have to report it was called a mandated reporter.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Now I'm sure that you're not abusing anyone or elderly people. But I want to explain how this exception works because it's a little more far reaching you may think. So say that you come in and you discuss with me a neighbor, right, that seemingly has nothing to do with your treatment, but just kidding. I mentioned that something's going on that discussion leads me to believe that your neighbor's abusing their child. I still have to report that, even though it has really nothing to do with you directly. It's something you just told me in passing. I'd have to act on it. Again, I would only release the information necessary to protect a child safety. Does that make sense?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It Does. Yes. \", \"completion\": \"So no matter how I find out about it, or who it is, I have to act on that.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"And then the last exception I want to review is, again, as with many of these very unlikely, but if for some reason you're involved in any type of civil or criminal litigation, and a judge orders me to testify. I have to testify. I can tell you this happens. Very Rarely, but it can happen. And I can and will try not to disclose me, I'll ask the judge to not disclose if you don't want me to, but ultimately a judge can order me and I have to. So in the end, it's up to the judge. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"So, again, most of these pretty unlikely, yeah. But I'd rather have all the information going forward so you don't have any concerns about where the information you're revealing or talking about where the information is going. Okay. Do you have any questions about that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"seems pretty clear.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. Well, I appreciate you sitting through that. Talk on confidentiality. So we're gonna get started now with the assessment. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Umm not not too good.\", \"completion\": \"Not so good ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No, I just got into a fight my parents\", \"completion\": \"what's been going on?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I I've been doing heroin for for a few months now. And I didn't think my parents knew but I guess they they found a needle in my room. And I mean they knew what I was doing. And they they told me that I have to start shaping up and I need to I need to stop doing any kind of drugs because they said they said the next time that they find find any kind of drugs and it's, it's it, they're gonna kick me out of the house.\", \"completion\": \"Alright, so they're at the point where anything else happens they discover it and you're on the street. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"What are your feelings about being on the street?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Who want to be out there ever? I don't know who would be.

I don't want to be out in the streets, but it's just gonna be so hard. So hard to give\", \"completion\": \"So there are conflicting feelings here. You don't want to be out in the street. But you don't want to give up the heroin same time.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right, Right. I just I mean, I don't want to give it up. But, I mean, I kind of know I have to. I mean, I'm a young guy, I I couldn't make it outside of my parents house and I definitely don't want to be on the streets.\", \"completion\": \"So you want to stop to avoid the consequences could happen.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right. But to this point haven't been able to.\", \"completion\": \"So this is the first consequence or potential consequences motivated you Right since you started using\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"How strong is the craving to use?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean when I first started it was I mean it was pretty freakin great. I mean the rush that you get from it it's it's just mind blowing it's it's just amazing. But of I've noticed recently that like the rush isn't as intense anymore and it's even like it's even kind of started to backfire a little bit where like actually I'll feel all sick without using it. And I mean that kind of scares me but the cravings are definitely still there.\", \"completion\": \"Right so when you when you try to cut back, have you tried to cut back?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I had before but a minute like there there is no reason to so I didn't try very hard.\", \"completion\": \"When you did try Did you have the feeling Were you getting sick?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I did. Yeah, it was an A it wasn't as bad as as any of my buddies but I definitely I mean I didn't I didn't feel well\", \"completion\": \"have your parents given you any options in terms of like Do they understand that your seems like you're a little dependent on\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I mean they they do I definitely like I don't hold anything against my parents I got you I have a pretty good relationship with them. I know what I'm doing isn't isn't good for me.

      "{\"prompt\": \"It is\", \"completion\": \"okay detox right.  So they have a they have a solution to help get you off the heroin, but there's still, there's still a part of you that doesn't want to go that route.\"}\n",

I mean, it's, it's hard for me to focus on like anything until sometimes until I get my next fix.\", \"completion\": \"Right. So there's, there's a few problems here. So So one is can you can you commit to going to detox and the second is, even if you successfully complete that, when you come back out, if you can build void the power\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"There's an alternative strategy here, right? She She comes to you, or you could go all the way around, and then only round back to return. And to get back and forth to work. You don't have to go by his house at all. \"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah, just straight up. I mean, when when there's nothing to do in the house, my parents are gone.

So onboard leads to using the drug assuming because that would alleviate the boredom?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right.\", \"completion\": \"Is there an adaptive response that you can put in right there that you can interject right at that moment? When you say, board? Is there a depth of response to couplets as soon as this post detox.\"}\n",

So I right now my usually my two choices when I'm bored are either to go to my buddy's house, or go to my gril's houses, you know, across from my buddy. So maybe that could just be like, one of the times I called my girl and be like, Hey, can you just like come over? We can do something like just kind of distract me from from, like, wanting to go over dance place, you know?\", \"completion\": \"So to the adaptive responses, call you girlfriend.\"}\n",

Right. And that's what brought you in today like to practice anyway. So I'm wondering if another adapter response response could involve, you know, I don't want any, any trouble.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"can use that one certainly, that's a good one, when she's not around. And you kind of revisit those consequences, new adaptive response. Do you think that's going to be enough motivation to keep you from going to the house?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I do. I mean I like as of right now, work scones good, like school is going good. I don't, I really don't want any problems.

So I think like, if I just remember to tell myself, like when I'm feeling bored if I just remember to tell myself like I don't, I don't want to be out in the streets and like especially I don't want to lose my job. Like I think telling myself those things that will help remind me like kind of what's at stake. You know\", \"completion\": \"Good, good.

      "{\"prompt\": \"well it's actually it's more during the day, it's more kind of day.\", \"completion\": \"So she could be an asset in terms of trying to stop you from leaving the house, but only when she's there. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"And similar to your father, you know, so it's really, I guess we kind of narrow it down to when you're home alone and particularly when your girlfriend's not available, that's your highest risk time right? \"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I think like one of the one of the other things I do to kind of clear my head as I like to go for a drive. So like if I if I start feeling bored I think maybe if I like get in my car And like I said, all of that that's his stuff. I just drive away, like, just physically leave the temptation. And then like from there, I can go to a bookstore or like a comic book store like I can, I could spend hours in there. So maybe if I can, like I can remind myself to drive away, go to the stores, and like, maybe I can just kind of stay out there like enough till either like my girlfriend's home or my parents come home.\", \"completion\": \"I think that's a good I think it's a good plan. Yeah. and remember that the more we apply these adaptive responses, right, what we hope is that you the risk decreases, like your craving decreases your motivation to stay clean increases\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right.\", \"completion\": \"So while it may be only convenient to drive someplace, every time no one's available, and you'd have thought that might not be something I do forever. \"}\n",

So this one of the things I wanted to talk with you about is I know that you did some assessments over the last couple of days. And so I want to talk with you about that and just talk with you about kind of treatment and how things are going to go. And based on that sounds like the what, from what you were saying in terms of the assessment process that you have an eating disorder, it's called bulimia nervosa, and I'm not sure if you've ever heard of that.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, a little bit yeah. Okay.\", \"completion\": \"So what I want to do is kind of describe that for you a little bit. So what you talked about was that there are periods of time when you have when you have eating episodes where you eat, like kind of a large amount of food that you feel like that you've lost control and you feel, you know, like overly full me vomit and the This happens fairly regularly. And there are times to when you, you know, you're maybe really overly concerned about your shape or your weight. And that feel familiar to you. Yeah. So and then it sounds like that's been going on for quite some time, at least, you know, two, three, sometimes even upwards of five times a week.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I, I'd say, Yeah. All right.\", \"completion\": \"So just want to let you know to about, about that, that it's not unusual. For a person like in college like yourself to be struggling with an eating disorder like this. In fact, we see upwards of 5% of women and call on college campuses who struggle with that and even more upwards of 20%, who have you know, kind of what we would call kind of variants of that in terms of excessive dieting, and some may even like, throw up or use laxatives or excessively exercise, so it's not unusual. One of the things we know about blaming Nervosa is that for a lot of women, it really starts by Excessive dieting. So like going for long periods of time without eating and sounds like that that was something that you endorsed as well that there are times when you kind of diet excessively. Yeah,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"especially when I was younger.\", \"completion\": \"One of the things that we know about bulimia nervosa is that when people overly restrict or you know, stop eating a lot or go for, you know, a day and a half and really restrict their calories, that oftentimes that that kind of leads into that kind of binge eating cycle. And we know that that's the case. The other thing that we're aware of is that a lot of individuals who struggle with eating difficulties like this also report a lot of difficulties they have like with managing stress or managing relationships or have a difficult time knowing what they're feeling or managing feelings. Is that something that you've experienced? Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, that's okay. Because in many respects, I think both things go on for individuals that struggle with eating difficulties like that. And so we know that there's a lot of dieting and restriction that goes on but we also know that there are other things that are happening in terms of managing feelings, managing stress, etc. So one of the things that I like to focus on in terms of working with clients and working with individuals like yourself is I take an approach it's called interpersonal psychotherapy and, and what that means, in essence is that I like to approach the eating problem by looking at kind of the kind of social in kind of more interpersonal context, because there's a lot of things that are probably going on, or may have gone on in your life that have been kind of associated with times and you've been more likely to use food or to restrict your calorie intake. And so what I'd like to do is really talk with you over the next, you know, few sessions about, you know, periods of time in your life currently and in the past where you've had, you know, overeating episodes and when you've restricted your calories, when you've You know, lost weight, or when you, you know binge and things like that and really start looking at, you know, patterns perhaps in your relationships and then what we'll do is kind of sum that up at the end of the time that we're together and see if we can kind of come up with a little bit of a game plan and some goals to help you reduce your binge eating. So how's that sound? Okay. And there's really good evidence for the things you know, the things that we're going to be doing, in fact, the more that we work on some of these issues, you'll you'll know pretty quickly that you're gonna start feeling a lot better and, and it'll have a, you know, pretty positive impact on your eating. Okay, great. So this is what I'd like to do is first of all, first of all, let's start with I want you to give me a recent episode, where like just recently within the last couple days where you've had one of those episodes that you talked about where you felt like a lot that you lost control, and that you ended up vomiting or you know, and and it will and kind of get an idea about that. And then what I'd like to do is and we'll go kind of back in time, and then I want you to tell me the first time that you had an episode like that. So and then then what we'll do then over the next couple of sessions is then we'll, we'll start from when it started and kind of like work our way up to the present. And I'll just ask you a lot of questions and we'll, you know, kind of go from there. Right? So why don't you tell me the Tell me like a recent episode, that where you felt like that you'd lost control. You're eating\"}\n",

And then when I took it, I failed. And I was held back. And I feel like, you know, that was so it was, it was really embarrassing for me to be held back. And I felt like I don't want to say but I did feel like a failure at the time. Because I felt like I really didn't know this. I don't know why I couldn't pass the test.\", \"completion\": \"And since that this was third grade.\"}\n",

And as you move forward from there, you've never really been thrilled about taking tests \"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. I mean, yeah, it is good. Yeah, it's good.\", \"completion\": \"But this particular test, which is not for scorches for work, yeah, this one, this is more of a stumbling block for you.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes.\", \"completion\": \"You have any ideas as to what may what may be what may be making this test such a point of anxiety for you?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I think it's just the fact that it's this promotion. So it's like the same thing. Like, if I fail, I'm being held back. And I feel like it's, we live in that moment of being held back. And that, that that's like a fear that I have that, um, that by not being able to pass these tests are holding me back.\", \"completion\": \"So it really that same feeling you've had in third grade. That's coming up with this test.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I mean, I didn't put them together until now. But yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And the other test you take in throughout the rest of grade school in high school they didn't, they didn't have that same value attached to them.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Now because they didn't have all that pressure that it was either win win or lose, basically, \", \"completion\": \"you could, you could take them again or take the course again or?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"or I could take another test to raise the grade if I didn't do good on that.\", \"completion\": \"so you have you maybe had more options in school?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes. Was it fail, you know, pass or fail?\", \"completion\": \"Right, So it's the, it's the pressure is the pressure of you need to get through this. And you don't have the safety nets that you had in school? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, if I fail it, then I'm not going to be able to get the promotion, I would have to wait. Just like I did not have to wait a certain amount of time. I think an ear before I could take it again.\", \"completion\": \"So this a lot of pressure.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah it is\", \"completion\": \"So is there any time limit to this test for work?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Um, no, there isn't.\", \"completion\": \"There's no time.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No\", \"completion\": \"How many Is it like a, like a multiple choice? \"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"You're really well prepared for it.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes.\", \"completion\": \"So I have a few a few thoughts about this. One is I'm wondering you know, we've talked before about cognitive therapy core beliefs. So I'm curious as to what you think about what core beliefs may be operating. For you now with this with this test, this work test\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"that  I could fail that if I fail I could end up being a failure at all, you know, the things that I try\", \"completion\": \"something like, I am a failure or I'm bound to be a failure, I'm destined to be a failure. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I would say like I'm destined to be.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so  destined to be failure. So that, so that, potentially, is a core belief. Right? That's, that's operating.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, that's what scares me. That's, that's exactly the thought that I'm thinking when I'm about to take the test. And if I don't pass that, it's just gonna have like this domino effect of failure.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so it could be a core belief, but it's also seems like you're still on that thought. Like as you get ready to take that test. You're thinking I'm just destined to be a failure. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And you're having what sounds like a panic response to heart racing.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, my hands shaking. \", \"completion\": \"Are you in the room alone? You're taking the test?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes, \", \"completion\": \"you are. So no one's really seeing you have this. I wouldn't want to call it a panic attack yet we haven't really gotten too far into it. But it sounds like it has some panic like features.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Because it's not. It's interfering with you thinking clearly enough to get to the items. So, okay. So one thought I have is you have you ever had panic attacks in the past or anything like this?, the third grade thing?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No, not really. I mean, sometimes I get worked out when I'm about to take a test, okay, but it's only around test.\", \"completion\": \"And what happens once you get worked up like once your heart rate increases and You have any other physiological symptoms would\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"want to actually do take the test?\", \"completion\": \"hmmm\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Um, I kind of try to work through it and start trying to answer one question at a time to get to the last question.\", \"completion\": \"So one one possible strategy here is we talked about the adaptive response. Right? So, which is that thought that you say to yourself that self talk, I wonder if your doctor response couldn't be I can ride this out like you have no time to test? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, that's true. \", \"completion\": \"I mean, the panic responses only maintained for so long\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"and I could also choose like maybe questions that are no the answer to automatically so that could help maybe release some of that stress\", \"completion\": \"to get some in a sense to get some minor victories under your belt by like, answering those right you know, you're closer to achieving your goal\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yes and then I feel like I know, at least I know that like, Don't validate the feeling that I maybe I can pass this test.\", \"completion\": \"So the more items you you answer correctly, the less anxious you're gonna feel because you're closer to the end of.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, definitely. Because then I start to feel more calm because I know that I know these questions are definitely going to be right.\", \"completion\": \"So that's so that's one well, that's a cognitive and behavioral strategy, right? Like you can you can wait out the panic. I mean, you're in the room alone.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, that's true. Nobody's there. Nobody's gonna see me. I'm kind of trying to get myself together. \", \"completion\": \"Yeah. Now the panic painful. Right, the you know, the panic symptoms are painful. So what you could tell yourself is, this isn't pleasant. But I can write out these symptoms because they only last so long. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Probabiy, I could use like self talk. \", \"completion\": \"Exactly. Yeah, because usually mean peg symptoms can run you know, five minutes. 10 minutes, 15 minutes. But you have no time limit? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah,\", \"completion\": \"yeah so if you can just kind of use that time to focus on the items, as you mentioned, you could get right. And kind of, at the same time be telling yourself I can ride this out.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I mean, I've done that in the past, so I can apply it to this test. \", \"completion\": \"So if that's worked for you that ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yes, that has worked and I passed. \", \"completion\": \"So that's, that's certainly that's certainly one adaptive response to try writing. Another one could be that, although it wouldn't be great to fail, you can retake the test in a year. Right. You could try it. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, that's true.\", \"completion\": \"I mean, I know that's not what you want, but, but the alternative is kind of buying into that automatic thought we know that's not working. Right. The I'm I'm Destin, that was the word right like I'm destined to be a failure. We know that's not working for you. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"So even if I have to take the test again and in a year, then I'm not going to be a failure because I still have the chance to take it again. It's not like I'll never be able to take this test again.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah, you just have, you just have another years of study, right? And, of course, you wouldn't have that promotion that time and that would be an outcome, I know you don't want. But it's not the end of your career, It's not like something so drastic it's important to you and I can appreciate that. But it's not the end of your career. You're not going to be unemployed.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No, no, definitely not. And just thinking back and relating it back to the third grade, even though I had to stay back. I still managed to, you know, do well the next year and keep moving up. And it hasn't really, in the long run prevented me from doing anything that I've wanted to do.\", \"completion\": \"So that's great. That's another adaptive response, which you've survived this before.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes, I definitely have.\", \"completion\": \"So this one event, I mean, I had the the incident third grade with the unpleasant experience but this one event you don't want that this kind of fashion. While use your word, your destiny by like this was one that seemed to catch you off guard but the the panic like symptoms. And fortunately your employer is going to give you the chance to retake and try this again. And, and I met you know, so you have I imagine you could you can write out these, these symptoms. And I think you have the other adaptive response, which is I've been successful this before.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. I mean, definitely I feel a lot better now because I just know that no matter what happens, I've been here before, and I can get through it as opposed to like that feeling that I'm going to just fail together.\", \"completion\": \"Oh, it's so good, when you have to take the test?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"on next week.\", \"completion\": \"So let's schedule one more appointment right before that.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay, right. \", \"completion\": \"And we'll, we'll make sure that you have these adaptive responses down and you're ready to go. Okay. And really will kind of focus on the positive outcome. Right. Okay, which is just taking this test taking one item at a time and fighting through some of these physical symptoms you're having, and fighting through the useful thoughts.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay. Yeah, I mean, that sounds good. That helped me prepare for the test. \", \"completion\": \"Great. So, Michelle, I'll see you. I'll see you then and work through it. I really appreciate you coming in today.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"This week? Um, I don't know. I guess it was a little bit more productive than usual. But not really, I'm still just usual, dead to the world. You know, you know, I'm just in my room most of the day, I'm not really part of the world or part of my family. I'm just closed off in my own little sad universe.\", \"completion\": \"So you're feeling isolated from your family?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, just feeling really disconnected. Just really, I don't know. It's just been a really tough week with my husband. We've been fighting a lot as usual.\", \"completion\": \"So when you say you're feeling disconnected Can you explain to me more what that looks like?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I guess. I'm just, I'm so tired all day and just exhausted and he has all these demands and all these things he wants me to do.

Just last night, came home yelling at me like usual and all the dishes are still in the sink and all the laundry was all on the bed. Like, I couldn't even tell him that like I looked online for jobs, which I was thought I should be proud of that I knew and no, I didn't find a job. So whatever It's that big of a deal. I just thought maybe like we could talk about that. But it was just feeling about shirts, maybe ironed and I just couldn't do any of it. \", \"completion\": \"So you feel that even though you made some progress by looking at them for jobs this week that you didn't feel much accomplishment from that because your husband didn't acknowledge it or appreciate it.\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Just makes my whole body just ache just makes me feel empty.

You know It just makes me feel really just just empty, just miserable.\", \"completion\": \"I hear you saying that you're shutting down.

That way you're sitting with your arms crossed, like I feel like you're closing yourself off To a lot of things to a lot of people.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, definitely because they don't notice anything I do. And I mean it's on Monday like I actually got out of the house which I thought was like a big deal in the moment. But I took the cat to the groomer, my husband's been bugging me about that for months and you know, I got out of house I drove the groomers I changed my pajamas and like all these things are a big deal to me, but he doesn't even see that accomplishment. Then even notice, like my daughter didn't notice either. She just comes home and slams the door doesn't even look at me. The cat was all groomed and nice little bow now.

I mean, otherwise, what's the point? You know, if they don't have that support, all they do is point out the things I haven't done, they'll do something but it's all about what hasn't been done.

      "{\"prompt\": \"It does still hurting but it's, it's okay. I feel I feel better that you're allowed to feel bad. I feel validated to help me. I need to help my family. I need to hurt and show them that I'm hurting but not feel guilty that we can do that. Hold on. I need this inside. Feeling things feel lighter like it's not even. \", \"completion\": \"So really, it just feels more when you hear that you think it's okay. I need to be validated. Tell yourself How can feel hurt without feeling guilty.\"}\n",

So what happened was she went to a bathroom at our local library, and she found a video camera when she was going to the bathroom\", \"completion\": \"in the bathroom?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, she actually, yeah. And she turned it into the police. And I guess because like she carried it, or she had found it. Her hand prints were on it and they weren't able to they weren't able to detect who actually did it. They weren't able to catch the \", \"completion\": \"probably didn't catch the person?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No. So send Then I've been on really just high alert, like, I'm worried that that could happen to me to my kids.

So how is it affecting your your daily life? Can you tell me kind of what your where you've been feeling?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Just all the possibilities that I could be recorded. I've just been very aware of them which makes me not want to go anywhere. So I've been having Arguing with my husband a lot because he wants to go out to restaurants and I don't want to go because there could be cameras in the bathrooms and how I dress also as you can see him kind of dress more conservatively because I remember hearing once about cameras that people use on shoes that could be you, you know use in a creepy way and so I I can't you know it's now almost summertime I can't dress and skirt or be comfortable because I'm dressing like that.\", \"completion\": \"So you have covered a lot of ground there.

      "{\"prompt\": \"right.\", \"completion\": \"Like anxiety and worry. So when you walk into a public restroom, what's the first thing that goes through your mind?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"that there might be a video camera that I don't see that that's maybe like with my friend that was big enough, but I might not catch it in that someone's going to use that in a vulgar way.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so when you walk in, you're wondering if there's a camera there. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And when that automatic thought occurs, what follows that in terms of a feeling or behavior?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Usually I'll try and find the camera but it's usually anxiety fear.

Sometimes I try and use bathroom at home so I don't have to go out.\", \"completion\": \"So you behaviors looking for the camera or sometimes just leaving without using a restroom. And you're You're feeling is that that anxiety worry there?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, \", \"completion\": \"we've been talking about. Okay. So, really, if we think about, we talked before about the core beliefs, intermediate beliefs, and wonder if the intermediate belief, isn't it, I'm vulnerable.

      "{\"prompt\": \"right, \", \"completion\": \"you know, committed that crime. And then, you know, that's combining with situations that you encounter, and that's where you're getting those automatic thoughts. So that sort of makes sense.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Exactly.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. So you remember what, what in terms of kind of therapy, you'd like to apply what we call the adaptive response or self talk. So it's that thought that you interject at that moment you realize you're having an automatic thought, that's going to be to in this case, anxiety and worry and behaviors that are looking for the camera isn't maybe useful behavior, but leaving, you know, that's that that could certainly be on useful behavior. So in terms of that self talk, let's let's work to develop a self talk response so that you could tell yourself to that initial, you know, I wonder if there's a camera in this bathroom. Right? What do you think you could tell yourself that would get in between that thought and the feelings you're having?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I could say if when I walked in the bathroom?\", \"completion\": \"Umm hmm\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"maybe I could say, Umm you know, while there could be a chance that there's a camera in this bathroom, the chance of it happening is not very likely. And You know, I'm gonna take steps to keep myself safe, so that I won't be in a vulnerable position such as looking for the camera.\", \"completion\": \"But it's good. So you have, you have a low probability of it happening, and you're taking useful behaviors to minimize your risk even further. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"Right. So that's a good automatic thought, I think are good adaptive response for the next thought rather. Why don't you Why don't you try that one out? Right, the next time. You had that on that thought? Right. Try out that. You know, I think that's really, you know, that's logical. I mean, it's, it's unlikely to happen. Of course, there's a chance. Right,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right.\", \"completion\": \"And we, we acknowledge that in the self talk, there's a chance that it could happen, but there's precautions you can take. That's a low chance sometimes as well, so keep that on Mac thought. We'll review it In the end, \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"okay, \", \"completion\": \"right before you leave today, we'll write these down. But that's that's one adaptive response rather that I want to write down for you. I also want to talk about like, the worst case scenario, because right now you have the anxiety worry about an event that while it's unlikely it could happen. It could happen. And I'm wondering how you think you would react? If it is the worst did happen if you if you use the restroom, and you found out through law enforcement or by finding a camera that an offender had been, you know, watching you right on recording. How would react to that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, I think I would be really upset. I think I would feel vulnerable probably for a while and be hesitant. I mean, I would think ultimately, that would be okay. My friend is happened a while ago, she's starting to get to get over it and get back to her usual routine, although she's still hesitant, so I think I would be okay. Eventually, although I'd be really upset that it happened.\", \"completion\": \"And it would make sense to feel upset. But that would be upsetting for anybody. But as you noted, that would probably be relatively temporary. \"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"It would probably go away. I learned to adapt. How long have you been in the state of anxiety and worry?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Probably it happened like two months, two months?\", \"completion\": \"And how many days and the average week are you affected by these feelings?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Every day, \", \"completion\": \"every day?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So if we can compare it right, we have a chance to be recorded, right illegally. That's a low probability event. It could happen. Probably not likely. The anxiety and worry that you're having. That's a high probability event because you're suffering from every day.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"And that's true. I never thought about it that way.\", \"completion\": \"So there's a, there's a point at which maybe you reach and you say, I'd rather take that route to take the risk, I'd rather deal with the potential consequences of that an unlikely event to be recorded and face that if it happens, then be in the state of anxiety, worry\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right, Because right now I'm suffering every day.\", \"completion\": \"Now you're suffering, right? And if, if you could adaptively respond effectively, you you're still gonna have that risk of being recorded. But you know, you could survive that event if it happened late.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I can get it\", \"completion\": \"And you're taking reasonable cautions and you know, things we talked about. So, as you think about this in a more general sense, is there a adaptive response, you could apply it to that, to that on that thought of, you know, I need to be worried about This or, you know, whatever that thought looks like sometimes the thoughts in image rights may like an image have been recorded, but whatever that kind of general series of automatic thoughts are that are that are getting you anxious or worried before you even get out of the house. What adapter response? Could you apply there?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Maybe, you know, like I said, I'm worried about all the cameras, maybe I could say, you know, I understand there's some cameras that, you know, use for good purposes, security, \", \"completion\": \"probably most are\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right. And the chances of being recorded illegally are not likely if, and I'm taking precautions to you know, go to the right places. The good areas, good areas. So it's not likely to happen overall. And me going outside the house is worth the risk. You know, the minimal risk that it would happen and if it did happen, I could survive.\", \"completion\": \"That's great. That's a great adaptive Yeah. And actually, that's kind of a few adaptive responses. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right, right. \", \"completion\": \"But that's good. And you can you can apply them and we'll, we'll kind of break them down. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Like I said, before you leave today, we'll break those down. So you can, you could have written down as you go out. I think it's important, because the automatic thoughts tend to spring on us quickly. It's important to rehearse these adaptive responses. So we're ready to go. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Right. And, and kind of, you know, we're being we're preparing ourselves to apply that adaptive response. And in order to be prepared you, you have to know what it is. So it's good to have it written down to kind of more or less commit to memory. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Does that make sense?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"All right. So, before we leave today, I'll take care of that. And I want you to use as adaptive responses for this week. I'll see you next week. And record what the outcome Was every time you're able to apply the response, and that includes what you felt and what you actually did. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"And of course, as you mentioned, any physiological reactions like your heart racing, right underneath that, so that's really that sub behavior. But note both a physiological behaviors and other behaviors. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. Once you're consciously controlling, and then any feelings, okay? And we'll go through them. We'll go through each time use it one by one, they have a there are and kind of see if we need to adjust the adaptive response and see how well it's working. Okay. That's the plan.\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Better? Well, last time we talked about that\", \"completion\": \"postponed gratification. Yeah,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"that um, and I think you wanted 10 minutes for me to put it off 10 minutes. Yeah. So I did better. I think I ended up only doing like join a half instead of two I was able to put offered, I think, the 10 minutes a couple times. And then there were there was, I think one or two days where I went out for a walk because I was Tired of staring at the clock waiting for the 10 minutes to pass. So I got up, went for a walk. And then I passed one of my friends. So I ended up walking with her. And I actually didn't get back to my house for like an hour. So I kind of put it off for like an hour because then I came home and took a couple hits on\", \"completion\": \"so it sounds like you were able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana. At least in most cases. It was rough.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It was rough. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So it was it was difficult for you, but most cases, you're able to pull off the 10 minutes. Mm hmm. That sounds like there's a few instances where you're able to hold it off longer because something else kind of Yeah, came up.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I found I actually talked to a couple people on the phone before I knew it like half hour to come by.\", \"completion\": \"so another activity presented itself and You've forgotten with marijuana.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Kind of Yeah. Yeah. I guess I just wasn't thinking about it.\", \"completion\": \"So have your feelings about marijuana change since we last talked?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No, not really. \", \"completion\": \"Tell me about that.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, it's I don't see it as a problem. It's it's legal in a lot of states now. And I mean, it's not that bad for you. It doesn't really endanger me much.\", \"completion\": \"So you still you still believe you should have the right to smoke marijuana?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I mean, I'm not hurting anybody else. \", \"completion\": \"But at the same time, you want to go back to work. And if I remember, right, you're the person that you could go work for. I guess you know them right. Yeah, it's my uncle, your uncle, and you need to be cleaned for was about two months.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, two to three months.\", \"completion\": \"So you have kind of opposing forces here, right? You have your enjoyment of marijuana. And then you, you know, that's something you like you don't wanna give up. And you believe you have a right to do that. But then there's that job.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I mean, my parents are pretty cool with it, like they know. But I mean, I'm at the point now where they kind of want me to move on and move out. But I don't know. I mean, I just, it'd be nice to have that job. Like, it's a really good job, but at the same time, like, I don't see why I have to sacrifice something that I like. \", \"completion\": \"So it doesn't seem fair to you. But she recognizes the reality of your situation.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So it really does come down in your instance to marijuana use or appointment.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, it's pretty accurate.\", \"completion\": \"So you're not happy about that choice. And kind of what we did with the postpone gratification was just really just ask you to wait 10 minutes and you were able to do that. And more, although it's difficult, \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"it's difficult.\", \"completion\": \"It's difficult for you. So I asked you to track the number of times you smoke marijuana. Did you really track that over the last week? Yeah, you remember how many times that was?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \" I think think I think it like 15. Okay, between 15 and 20,\", \"completion\": \"between 15 and 20. And how many times did something kind of get in the way that's something else come up in that 10 minutes span that distracted you or that you enjoyed\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I'm like, almost closer to 20 times I guess, otherwise, I probably would have kept going smoke more. I mean, there were a couple times where like somebody would call me or somebody would text me and that kind of distracted me and so I was able to put it off for a little bit.\", \"completion\": \"So you can see in that 10 minutes, things can happen. Right things can happen that can help you to avoid the marijuana. Sometimes nothing does and after 10 minutes, use it. And sometimes something does kind of get in the way with a marijuana like distract you or you have another activity that you enjoy and then you didn't use. So with that in mind you found the experience rough, but was it tolerable? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, Was it bad \", \"completion\": \"was a bit Do you think for this next week? We could try postpone gratification from 10 minutes to 20 minutes?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't know. That seems kinda. Yeah, that seems like a longer time\", \"completion\": \"that that is definitely. That is a longer time. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't know about that.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Maybe like 15 minutes,\", \"completion\": \"no compromises. 15 Okay, do you think you could maintain 15 minutes weighing 15? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I think I could try a little bit more than 20.\", \"completion\": \"All right, so let's go with 15 minutes, right. So 15 minutes, you know, as compared to 10. I'll give you five extra minutes that something could happen that could distract you. And you wouldn't use that instance, right. There's also, you know, to constructively use that time, you could consider alternatives like like you mentioned walking right. You could use that time and start walking. Yeah. Anything else that that you like, maybe in the past on occasion when you want to use marijuana, but she didn't have anything available? What would you do instead?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"binge watch TV,\", \"completion\": \"or should it be okay, well, so perhaps in that 15 minute time period that that timer you're delaying using marijuana, you could start watching the show.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I can do that.\", \"completion\": \"At the under 15 minutes, you might end up using marijuana or you might want to continue watching the show. So do you see kind of how it works? Like is it making sense to you the postponing?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, it doesn't make it any easier, but it's tough for you. Yeah. Yeah. No, I definitely see how helps\", \"completion\": \"And maybe if we're successful to 15? Who knows? We'll move it up from there.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Maybe we'll see how the 15 goes, see\", \"completion\": \"how it goes the 15? Yeah, I'll see how that goes. You know, I'm hoping. And I hope this kind of makes sense that there'll be a point where you will be really interfering with the vast majority of the times that use marijuana. Like because you're giving yourself that many more opportunities, the longer you wait. Right. The more minutes you wait, the more opportunities for something else to get in the way so to speak. And probably what you'll see, just like you saw this last because you're, you know, you used marijuana less frequently, just by waiting the 10 minutes. Even though you described as difficult I'm sure it was, but there were a few times where it kind of worked out\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So, I think that planning something for that time would be helpful. And try to plan something 15 minutes, even if you fully intend to beyond the 15 to go right and use, I think it's still useful plan something in there. You never know that might take you. Or you might end up walking or watching TV or doing something else that would distract you or pull you away from the marijuana use. Okay. So that's like a plan.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I think I can give that a try. Okay\", \"completion\": \"Sounds like a plan?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I think we can manage that.\", \"completion\": \"All right. We'll go with that. And I'll see you next week. Okay, thank you.\"}\n",

And I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent and maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and, and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. So he, he actually see me because you went to him for increased stress. And he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase And prior to prescribing anything, you want to make sure that you at least had someone to talk to that\"}\n",

It's not a sort of super high risk, but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress might be some physical ailments related to alcohol as well could could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there, or even stay there.

So that also increased a little bit more. So perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here. And for women, healthy woman your age, no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be low or no risk and one seven in one week, seven total in total a week and what you say here is that even on this sheet, you're perhaps already drinking more than that.

And certainly there's there's conflicting information out there about what's healthy and what's not healthy. Imagine the increased stress work because we're concerned doctor seal as your stress increases, and if you were to describe you anything, maybe some interaction between the two, that would also be a concern for him.

I'm not completely sure. So you've had some success in the past of changing behaviors. And if you were to decide to make any changes here that sounds like you could draw upon that to make those changes. How important would it be for you on a scale of zero to 10? I have a low visual hero that if zero is not important, ten is very important to do something about your drinking wine.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I mean, if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking, then it's fairly important, maybe about seven. \", \"completion\": \"It's it's pretty up there.

But now if it's going to, if Dr. Seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety, and it meant that I had to not drink at all, I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time.\", \"completion\": \"So you'd be willing to stop altogether. That's what was indicated by the physician. Okay. So based on that, how ready are you to do anything right now, whether it's to cut back whether it's to quit?\"}\n",

It sounds as though you're pretty motivated to do something about this right now, given any responsibilities given your children learning at this point. And just on lowering anxiety, in general, it sounds and that's one of your goals as well. Well, I'm pretty confident Once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do, you'll be able to follow through with it. Based on your experience in the past of making behavior changes. I mentioned some things that you can draw upon. What's one thing that you could do? Imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress.\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I think we have had some problems at work. And I felt more stressed about work than I normally do. And basically, I was just trying to get into town one day on a day off and it was very hot, very funny, hot days and it just happened. My heart just started. to race and race and race and I couldn't get my breath, I was just like gasping for breath. Then I start to get chest pains and it was just awful. And I managed to sit down and call my husband and he, he came out, he actually left work to come and get me. \", \"completion\": \"Right. So that sounds like quite an unpleasant experience.\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"I can't get into town now without my husband taking me My husband has to take me to from work.

      "{\"prompt\": \"personal things, personal things. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. I guess I'm wondering if you're talking about your sex life there.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Right.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Now I just feel, you know that I shouldn't do anything like that, because it just might put too much strain on me.\", \"completion\": \"So you're avoiding sex in case that puts your heart rate up.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah yeah\", \"completion\": \"Okay, How's that affecting things between you and your husband?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"My husband's getting really fed up with it to be honest. He's been really, really kind and really supportive. But I think it's starting to affect his life quite a lot now. So he wanted me to go to the pub last week and absolutely promised that I would, because I've begun to stop wanting to go out because I'm so afraid it's gonna happen. I promised and promised him I go to the pub. And then when it came to it, I just couldn't. I just sat on the sofa and it started happening again. And then I was worried that if I went to the pub, I'd actually like get ill in the pub. And then it's really embarrassing for everybody. So just that I couldn't go in, and I think he's getting a bit To the end of his tetanus because it just seems to come out of the blue. And I've never suffered from anything like this before.\", \"completion\": \"It sounds like he's getting to the end of his tether because it also sounds like you're pretty fed up with the whole thing as well. Julie\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah. \", \"completion\": \"So just so that I've got the story straight. This all began about six months ago. Before that, had you had anything like this? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No, not at all. I mean, I think we had a new manager at work, I work in a bank only and then we had a new computer system put in and so it became very much stressful for all the staff not just me. And that's I can sort of see that I was in a lot more pressure and that could be affecting me.\", \"completion\": \"So just to make sure I've got the right the right way around. It began six months ago, pressure at work went to town you had the first of these attacks. And then since then you've had some more and now it's kind of got to the point that you don't want to go out to don't get to town by yourself. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No, I don't want to risk it to be honest. \", \"completion\": \"You know, you don't go to the pub, not socializing like you used to and you avoiding things like exercise and things like sex and having a bit of a taking its toll on your relationship. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah yeah yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. Okay. And looking at your I know, you've had an ECG, Dr. Jones, organized for you a couple of months ago. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"What have you been told about the results of that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well Dr. Jones said that it was okay. And there were no problems. And, you know, I did feel relief, you know, because, obviously, there's been events in my family, my dad died of one, you know, 72. So I'm thinking it must be my heart. There must be something wrong with it right now. It did feel pleased when Dr. Jones said that. But on the other hand, nothing's changed. You know, I'm still getting exactly the same problems. Nothing, you know, not getting any help with it. I just feel a bit like well, so I haven't got a bad heart according to the experts, but I'm still getting all the same symptoms you kow worse and worse.\", \"completion\": \"So even though the your GP told you there's no, there's nothing to worry about with your heart. Do you still worry that There might be something wrong with your heart?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I can't understand it. What do you think of Dr. Julia?\", \"completion\": \"I think I agree with Dr. Jones. I don't think there is anything wrong with your heart. The reason I say that is that you've had an ECG, which has come back perfectly normal. And usually if there was a problem with the heart the ECG would pick something up. Also, you've got none of the risk factors really for heart disease, because you you don't smoke, your blood pressure, from what I can gather from you notes has always been fine. You're fairly young. Before this, you were pretty fit and active. And also, I know you're worried about your dad having had a heart attack, but actually, he was a lot older than you are. And so you're not really in the same risk sort of bracket as he would have been. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"So I don't think that there is a problem with your heart. I guess what I'm what Is weather actually, what's going on is a little bit more what Dr. Jones thought weather actually this, this might be the anxiety that's giving you a lot of these symptoms. Have you ever thought it might be that rather than a heart problem?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I think I've been thinking more recently, it could be because my friend has like panic attacks. I've discussed it with her and she said, to be honest, it just sounds like that. I've always thought it was my heart. And what I can't understand is how my brain is making my heart start racing like it is. \", \"completion\": \"It's right. Okay. Has anyone explained to about anxiety and panic attacks?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't really know.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, well, perhaps it would be helpful to sort of hear a little bit more about that. What we have on top of our kidneys is two little glands and they called our adrenal glands. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"And they produce a hormone called adrenalin. Have you heard of that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \" Yes, I have heard of that\", \"completion\": \"okay. And what adrenalin does is it prepares us for situations of fight or flight? Is that a term you perhaps remember from biology at school?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I do. I do. Yeah. I Do\", \"completion\": \"you remember what we mean by fight or flies?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I think like, if you're in a scary situation, you fight or you run away, basically your body sort of triggers that.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"to do it.\", \"completion\": \"Yes, exactly. It's what's released to allow you to do the flight or fight response in the adrenaline. So when your body needs to get ready to do something, it's surges out a load of adrenaline, and the adrenaline basically gets you ready for action. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"So it does things like it puts your heart rate up, it makes your breathing speed up, you're ready to run. It can sometimes make people feel as though their mouth is dry. It can sometimes make people feel a bit lightheaded. But those are the kinds of symptoms that you can get.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"All of those actually Okay.\", \"completion\": \"What often happens with people with panic is that the first time that happens the first adrenaline release Out of the blue, perhaps at times of stress, and you mentioned that there was stuff going on at work, and you're feeling a bit stressed out and you're in town, it was a bit hot. So that may have been what was behind that very first panic attack. What happens to people is that once they've had one panic attack, they go on to have more. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Hmm.\", \"completion\": \"And the reason for that is that once you've had something like that happen to you, you're kind of there thinking, Oh, will this happen again? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Is that something that you are Absolutely sure. I have started to really monitor my heart And when it starts to race, I start to get worried. And then it starts getting faster and faster So it does feel that's\", \"completion\": \"Yeah, you describing it Exactly. Julie, that's what we call hyper vigilance. So you they're kind of keeping a bit of an eye on your heart. And for most of us, our heart rate will go up and down all through the day, but most of us don't worry about it, because we don't notice it. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"But because you've had a panic attack you they're thinking, What's my heart doing? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And then the minute it starts to change, you clock it You notice it, and then you start to get anxious thoughts, you might worry And\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I really start worrying, thinking thinking, is it going to be now? You know, is my heart gonna stop beating\", \"completion\": \"Right, So you get those kinds of anxious and they're very frightening, because you're thinking, Oh, my goodness me could my heart's on that makes you even more anxious, and that causes even more adrenalin to be released. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"And that makes the symptoms even more pronounced. And then that makes you believe even more that there's something wrong with you. Does that make sense to what might be happening?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It does make sense doctor\", \"completion\": \"One of the things that you have been doing, which is something that a lot of people with anxiety do is that you've started to, to avoid doing things that trigger it off. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, like not walking to town or anything like that anymore. \", \"completion\": \"Exactly. And whilst in the short term that sort of alleviates your symptoms, because you don't have to get panicky, what's happening is that the more you avoid doing things, the less likely you are to ever get round to finding out whether or not anything awful, really happens. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Does that make sense?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It Does. it just makes sense\", \"completion\": \"Well, if we all started to tackle this as if it was an anxiety problem, there are a number of approaches, we can think about tablets. And we're gonna think about other kind of talking approaches. There are pros and cons to those and side effects and things that we need to discuss. So I'm just slightly watchful of the time, we seem to be coming to the end of today's session for the appointment, but all right, well, I wonder is whether we should meet again, perhaps next week, and look again, more carefully at some of the treatment options and think together about which might suit you best. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"how would that sound?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"You know, that's fine. That's fine. \", \"completion\": \"Any other questions before we end this session\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Sometimes I have problems like with my attention and you know, I was looking at online and I'm really worried that I might have ADHD\", \"completion\": \"ADHD. Alright, so we'll, we'll talk about that. Let me ask you a few quick questions before we we get to that. Do you ever feel depressed\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No\", \"completion\": \"or anxious?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"It really It really does.\", \"completion\": \"It's really problematic. Wow. All right. Okay, so I'm going to ask you a few other questions here. We talked about the attention. So it's hard for you to give attention and hold attention. \"}\n",

They said there's nothing nothing that I really couldn't do and just try to not have it happen much more if I can\", \"completion\": \"just do what I can to not miss more. So they said that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, but yeah. They kind of just said, you know, do what you can do not have it happen, but if it you know if it has to happen, you know, what can I do about it? It was kind of they were saying\", \"completion\": \"so, they were understanding?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I didn't feel like they were that understanding, but I also didn't feel like they were gonna take any punitive action against me, right, right then and there or anything.\", \"completion\": \"Did you anticipate worst reaction than you experienced?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I did. And I also anticipated that they would maybe have more of a procedure for how to handle it and they didn't have a procedure which also made me feel a little worried. I can't imagine I'm the first mom that has had to deal with this. And they kind of talked like It's never happened before. So I kind of felt anxious, because I thought, am I really the first mom that's had to take a lot of time off because their child sick. They didn't give me the impression that they had sort of a protocol or like they had dealt with this before.\", \"completion\": \"As a sort of like it took them by surprise?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, or they just didn't have a plan for what to do about it.\", \"completion\": \"And they were investing a lot of energy in thinking about that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No, no, I guess not.\", \"completion\": \"And when was the second how long?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Just this past week, this week.\", \"completion\": \"So how has this week been back at work?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh, it's been very busy because I'm trying to catch up and get everything handled. But that's the way it always, always is. So nobody has said anything to me or anything about the absences \", \"completion\": \"other than that first and other ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And there's been no more absences?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Nope\", \"completion\": \"Okay, earlier you mentioned being a good mom How a good mom look lik?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Umm somebody who takes care of their child and puts them makes them a priority, like their first priority. And, you know, does the things that they need to do to make sure their child is taken care of.\", \"completion\": \"And you're a little worried through this was last experience you're talking about that you didn't rise level of good mom?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I felt like I wasn't being a good mom because I was preoccupied and making work a bit of a bigger priority than taking care of my kid.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so so good, mom's more about More than just rather, your behavior, right, what you're doing is about what you're also thinking. So you took care of your child. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"But your mind, your thoughts are somewhere else some of the time. And that's where you feel like you've, you've wandered out of the good mom area. Okay, I've been on the other side, how about a good employee? Did you mention that? You want to be a good employee? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"What's what's that look like?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Um, well, somebody that, you know, takes care of all of their workload and handles all of the tasks that they have each day and someone that's consistent and reliable, and, you know, puts effort into what they're doing and gets their job done. Really, you know, reliably.\", \"completion\": \"And that's where you feel like with the sort of the last workdays you missed. You missed three. Okay, how about last year? How many days have you missed?\"}\n",

They would just dock my pay for that day.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I guess I could contact the HR department.\", \"completion\": \"I'm just thinking because you're just one day away, from being at that number might be prudent just to talk with them and see. See, you know what to expect, right? So this whole thing though, the missing days caused you anxiety, frustration.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, a little bit\", \"completion\": \"about any type of feeling down at all?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"A little bit sometimes when I start feeling like I'm a bad mom.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so that so as far as your child is concerned in your relationship with your child, yes, some anxiety relationship at work, some anxiety, but the sadness mostly surrounds how you feel you're treating your job. Of all the emotions of frustration, anxiety, what I'll refer to as depression I should say sadness. What's bothering you the most? What? emotional response is probably the most?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"probably sort of the guilt and the feelings of not being able to be the best mom.\", \"completion\": \"How would you rate yourself right now as a mother if say 10 was the best mother you could imagine? Right? And one was the absolute worst?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I'm probably like an eight.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. That's pretty good, right? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"What would be the cutoff to where? What's the cutoff score? And that will scale I just gave it for good mother and not good mother.\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, feel like It's not good enough for me. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. Okay\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I wouldn't be okay with that.\", \"completion\": \"So if you look at somebody else, another person in similar situation of five would be acceptable. Right? \"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, that's not \", \"completion\": \"that's not gonna cut it?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"Well, we've cut it. \"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"sure?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No\", \"completion\": \"not sure. Okay. So you're close to the border. Like you're close to the border on you're your value system of being not a good mother.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes, not as good a mother as I want to be\", \"completion\": \"Okay. Now, what do you want to be?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I want to be like a eight or higher,\", \"completion\": \"eight or higher where you are in s you said?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"okay. So you want to be the parent sounds like\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, yeah, doesn't everybody want to be the best at what they do?\", \"completion\": \"I mean, I think people are driven to, to do their best. But is it crucial to be perfectly crucial to be a 10?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No, there's some leeway, I guess you have to allow for that.\", \"completion\": \"Remember before in other sessions for the situations you've brought in here, we've talked about dysfunctional thinking, irrational thinking. How does reflect on that, like the usefulness of of these thoughts? The, you know, the other mothers can be a five and B. And that's, that's good, right? You need to be an eight or hire a nine or 10 , does it seem useful, like a useful way of thinking?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"In some ways, it's useful because it keeps me keeps me on track if that makes sense. It keeps me pushing to keep doing the best I can.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, So it does have a useful side does have an unusual side less than useful?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, yeah, I guess it does in the sense that if I become too worried about it, then I'm wasting energy on worry instead of being able to put that energy into being good mom.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. So I guess one things I'm getting at here is has to worry has the anxiety or it paid off for you?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Probably not.\", \"completion\": \"Why not? So you're suffering with it?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"it might make you a little more vigilant but mostly most, it's just causing suffering.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So at the heart of it, you're not a bad mom. Right? You're in good mom category. You're a good employee. Right. But your, your way of dying yourself, Your perception is that you're not doing a great job at either one.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Exactly.\", \"completion\": \"And that's the thinking I'm getting that it's not, you know, it's not necessarily irrational. I'm thinking it's just less than useful. It's dysfunctional.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I can see that.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah, we're talking about that third day, right. The the third day of work you had to you had to call off. And do you remember any specific thoughts that are going through your mind on that? What was that a morning when you figured it out? Like a Friday morning?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Um, no, it was really the night But, um, well, you know, I went as far as to think, am I gonna get fired? You know, I had to kind of think about\", \"completion\": \"so your thought was, am I gonna get fired? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And then what was the feeling that that came right after that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"panic and worry Oh, yeah, \", \"completion\": \"maybe some anxiety?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"some anxiety? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Were you able to do anything to address that panic or your anxiety at that time? Like, did you tell yourself anything? Or did you take some action?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh, I did tell myself that I didn't go over yet. And, you know, hopefully I won't, you know, there's still a chance that I'm not going to go over on my days and hopefully won't go so far as to fire me, you know,\", \"completion\": \"and how did you feel after you  consciously had that thought?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"a little bit better, but the still kept hovering around. Yeah\", \"completion\": \"the whole time. Probably all the way till Monday, right when you returned to work?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Yeah. Like I wanted to call somebody at work and talk to them about it and make sure it was okay. But you know, it was the weekend, so I couldn't do any of those things. I just had to wait it out. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So we've talked before about self talk, you might remember me saying the phrase adaptive response, right? So it's the kind of pre packaged response we have two thoughts that we've identified is not so useful. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"So degree, those thoughts like, Am I going to get fired and all that? Not very useful in that moment? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes. not useful in that moment\", \"completion\": \"understandable. Right, but not useful.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah\", \"completion\": \"So what's you had sort of some self talk that you apply on your own, what some other self talk with some other another thought that you could think or something you can say yourself that could counter an automatic thought like that. Like, specifically, I'm gonna lose my job.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I guess I could say, you know, I didn't, you know, I'm not. I haven't had any conversations with anybody that have indicated that. So sort of like maybe I just need to not worry about it or cross that bridge when I come to it kind of thing. Like, hopefully it won't. I don't know if it will happen or not. And hopefully it won't happen.\", \"completion\": \"So, so there the self talk there is there's no clear indication that's gonna happen, \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right\", \"completion\": \"So why borrow the worry? Right? How about other habit adaptive behaviors? We talked about the importance of support systems before other sessions. Is there anybody else that could watch your child if you were really running up against that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, my mom can. can sometimes I did call her this this week to see if she could take one of take a day. But she couldn't because of what she had going On, but in in other times she might be able to take a day and stay home or my sister can do that as well. And my husband can sometimes it depends on what is going on that week for him at work. So there are some options there.\", \"completion\": \"Did you explore those options for this last time?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I did. I did, but just the circumstances didn't work out. \", \"completion\": \"So none of those individuals were available?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right.\", \"completion\": \"Is there any other options you have for care? Was that it?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"That's really it. You know, when she's sick, and that's really it, because you don't i don't want to put her around any other kids, which is why I wouldn't send her to daycare. So\", \"completion\": \"that seems reasonable. Okay, so there are some things you've already done. Right. And I think at this point, since to address I know this is the lesser of your worries, which is your employer, you're more worried about being a good mom, but to go look at the employer side first. Second, you can talk to HR, you can try to understand what the consequences are for going over explained that doesn't appear to be your fault. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. And I don't know what you can do in terms of support, maybe try to get a better awareness of the schedules when they're available and or convey the nature of your problem to them. Customer Support \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So that was one issue. Now if you highlight more prominently though, the good mother want to touch on that as well. You did everything you had to do to care for your child?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes,\", \"completion\": \"Are you sure?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, \", \"completion\": \"okay hundred percent ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Except for my my thinking I was maybe a little not as present as I should have been.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. And we'll get to that but your behavior behavior. Yeah, you did everything a good mom would do.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. So is it okay? If you're doing everything you need to do to think thoughts that don't seem congruent with that, you know, the distract you away from that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I guess it's not ideal, but it's okay.\", \"completion\": \"It's not ideal. So you'd really rather be have the ability to be really focused on what's going on your child to the exclusion of what's going on other circumstances?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"you know, or at least be able to put my worry about the other circumstances aside for the time for that time period.\", \"completion\": \"So by addressing the employer issue, that might give you a little relief one good mom ish. All right. So here's another opportunity to talk about dysfunctional thoughts. I think that is reflect on whether you're a good mom or not, you're really basing it on this idea that if I'm thinking about something other than my child, I'm in the wrong place in terms of being a good mom. Are you only being distracted?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"so that pushes you on a one to 10 scale?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"the more thoughts you have like that you think of it as like pushing you down toward five.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. So when you have those thoughts what's an adaptive response or you know, self talk, what can you tell yourself in those moments?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"that I'm doing them behaving doing the behaviors that I need to do and the baby doesn't know what I'm thinking so probably not. She doesn't know what I'm distracted or worried. So I'm not doing any harm to her.\", \"completion\": \"Who doesn't know you're distracted or worried?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I guess just me.\", \"completion\": \"Just you?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So the self talk that would be I'm doing what I have to do to be a good mom. And that's what my child says. Right\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right.\", \"completion\": \"But I have these understandable thoughts that come in where I worry about other things and more or less justice what it is, right? I mean, you're permitted to worry about things life isn't going to be worryfree\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"true.\", \"completion\": \"But we can, we can work to not suffer more than we have to \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right\", \"completion\": \"That kind of makes sense?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. It makes sense. And, you know, when you say it back to me the things that I'm saying it does sound a little bit irrational, or unhelpful less than useful. \", \"completion\": \"Yeah, it's a little less than useful it's not, you know, I want this important distinction. It's not good or bad right. And those words have a function right in our in our lives, but they're a little dangerous when applied in terms of mental health when they're applied to things like you know, good mom, bad mom. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"But doesn't leave a lot of gray area to talk about. improvement. Right? Also, it seems like what you're describing your, your way into the good mom category anyway. Sure. 8 or 10 I think most people would be happy with an eight out of 10. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"TRUE\", \"completion\": \"So it's not like you've drifted down toward five before somewhere. Okay. So there's a couple different Yeah, I know we talked about two different subjects, right, but they're related the work situation and situation care for a child. But those are some self talk strategies. So I'd like you to do when you go home today, and I would I would ask you to do it today if you can. Okay, I think it's important in the states in terms of time, near when we're having this conversation. If you could try to document some of those automatic thoughts. Remember, I gave you a worksheet before and then work on some of your own calm adaptive response. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay okay.\", \"completion\": \"Maybe around this area or maybe about other areas as well, it doesn't. It's okay. If you have other problems you'd want to apply the model to, but certainly around this issue of the childcare versus the work performance. That's the real struggle that's going on right now inside of you. Is that right?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes. Yes.\", \"completion\": \"Do you think you'd be able to have that completed? next week?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah, I think I can handle that. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. So we'll leave it there and I'll see you next week.\"}\n",

And I used to trust my judgment, but now I feel like how do I know that I'm making the right decisions?\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. Well, and this is really the one of the key parts of what may be causing this distress. We talked about this insecurity. You're on this I'm sure. And so you know, one question may be, did you make a efficient or less efficient decision with this particular family but the larger question is, you as a person can you can you do this, this job and if you do it and make money Like, what would you do then? Could you go through this again?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I think that's where the fear is, is that if 99 times out of 100 I do it right, there's still gonna be that one that I messed up. And I'm starting to feel like that one mistake could be like, life changing for somebody.\", \"completion\": \"And it could be you certainly in a job where, like, most jobs where mistakes have consequences. You also do a lot of good for a lot of people. So by you not being in the field. They're not getting the benefit of the skills you have.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I guess that's true. Like, yeah, maybe somebody else could come and replace me but do I think that they would be better at it? I don't know. I feel like I was pretty good at it before I started. have all these doubt.\", \"completion\": \"So, so mostly This was good until recently. Well, alright, let's look at this from another point of view. You really seem like, you can empathize with these families. You really, to me, it seems like you really know what they're feeling.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah I care about them\", \"completion\": \"and appreciating their perspective. Take a moment and try to walk in their shoes. If a professional like yourself came to you and your family situation and maybe you're engaged in the activities where it was warranted that your family we've broken up temporarily. What would you want? How would you want them to process that? Like you said, thinking about the caseworker from the point of view of the family? How would you want them to feel that? Would you want them to process that decision?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't know. That's a hard question. I mean, if they took my kids away, even if it was the right thing, I would want them to be at least a little bit, you know, feel a little bit bad about having to make such a hard decision. But I guess if, you know, if they fell apart, every time that they made that kind of decision, they wouldn't be able to help other people.\", \"completion\": \"So from the family's point of view, if you're in that situation, you can appreciate what the caseworker has to do. Well, you'd like to have some compassion for you. Okay, that seems reasonable. Yeah. So now flip back into the role you're in. You made the decision you had to make although you're second guessing it That's separate. Do you have compassion for them?\"}\n",

So I'll put the key in, and I'll hear it click, but then I just like doing it 12 times just to make sure it's locked. And that made me late for work. And then when I was at work, I have a drawer on the cashier. Um, so I would just make sure it was locked, but I would have to do it, you know, 12 times just make sure was locked.

Right. So you're hoping that I'd send you four more tests?\"}\n",

Well, I think Barbara having having heard his story and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and they've not shown anything. And you symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that they'd show anything different than what we already know.

And it clearly you have lots of physical symptoms and they clearly getting in the way of your life and causing you a lot of disability. I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Sometimes these things can go together. I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married, and you were very busy and quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less and when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much. Sometimes somehow his symptoms then will seem greater. So I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara is if the might be some kind of a link with you between how you feel In your mind and what's going on in your life, and and how much you symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility?\"}\n",

Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really with those, none of those have really helped you.

And whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. And the fact that you, you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it's worth of sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of these symptoms Worse, I guess.

How would that sound?\"}\n",

It's very difficult to complete homework worksheets, because things happen, right? I don't feel that Well, sometimes things get in the way. There's things that just prevent me from doing that.

Well, I think something that will be useful for both of us, Charles is to collaboratively work together and figure out how we can look at the perceived benefit of doing some of these things. versus the cons.

One decision is to engage in activities, and there's some benefit to doing that. And then another decision would be to not engage in activities. There's benefit to that. But there's also cost to both of those decisions. So I think one objective way for you to look at this worksheet would be to determine what are the sort of things you could do and determine whether there's more benefit or cost to completing that? What do you think about that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, that would depend on the activity. I know but okay. I could, I could get in touch with somebody I could call a friend.

      "{\"prompt\": \"he might want to talk about what's going on in my life and I'm ready We don't want to talk about that let somebody talk about it with you course. Okay.\", \"completion\": \"So it sounds like the most practical one of those would be that he may be busy.\"}\n",

So I'd write that is a great job Charles with the top two boxes with the first decision. So let's move to the second decision, which would be to stay the same and there's some benefit to that and there's some cost to that as well. Sure. Okay, Charles, so we completed the worksheet. So what's your overall impression about the benefits of changing versus the cons and staying the same?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, it makes sure that the, the benefits outweigh the cons. If, if I make the change if I don't make the change I'll be doing just what I've been doing and I'll be getting up wondering, what's the point? And well still be lonely.

And I've run out of space to put everything in because I really wanted to actually get a new dining room set like tables and chairs and maybe a cabinet and he has an SUV. So I called him to see if he could come in so I could purchase the items but he said he wasn't he couldn't come out and I guess he kind of said he was worried about you spending that much money.

So you're in, you're in a position where you have to make some decisions about people's lives. And sometimes those decisions result in people being separated from the family. Sometimes they don't.

It's, it's good for them, you know, maybe it could be a wake up call for the parents, or if not, at least the kids are getting their needs met and stuff like that. It's probably really hard for the kids and they probably want to go back to their parents. But I think overall, we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't think that it would be best for the kids to go to a place where they're going to be taken care of.\", \"completion\": \"So immediately, there's some pain because you have to pick up the family but the long run.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Yeah, I think so. And I'm not sure anybody else would have made a different decision either.\", \"completion\": \"So you really did what you had to do.

Let's consider a situation where you did make a mistake. That would be the worst case, right? We're just taking things to the worst case scenario. Okay. Your fear here is that in a sense, regardless of what already happened, going forward, you'd be mortified to make an error. Because this pain you're feeling right now. There's just a variable that's thrown everything into chaos for you. So looking around like where you work and and the history of your profession, what's the mistake you see people make from time to time and you'll be frightened of.\"}\n",

And, you know, she was kind of bothered me the past couple weeks, but really, this this past week was like the worst, right? So she's not doing her paperwork. And the thing is, is that she has to do these reports in order for me to do my reports. So if she doesn't have hers, I can't do mine.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Maybe like 15 minutes,\", \"completion\": \"no compromises. 15 Okay, do you think you could maintain 15 minutes weighing 15? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I think I could try a little bit more than 20.\", \"completion\": \"All right, so let's go with 15 minutes, right. So 15 minutes, you know, as compared to 10. I'll give you five extra minutes that something could happen that could distract you. And you wouldn't use that instance, right. There's also, you know, to constructively use that time, you could consider alternatives like like you mentioned walking right. You could use that time and start walking. Yeah. Anything else that that you like, maybe in the past on occasion when you want to use marijuana, but she didn't have anything available? What would you do instead?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"binge watch TV,\", \"completion\": \"or should it be okay, well, so perhaps in that 15 minute time period that that timer you're delaying using marijuana, you could start watching the show.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I can do that.\", \"completion\": \"At the under 15 minutes, you might end up using marijuana or you might want to continue watching the show. So do you see kind of how it works? Like is it making sense to you the postponing?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, it doesn't make it any easier, but it's tough for you. Yeah. Yeah. No, I definitely see how helps\", \"completion\": \"And maybe if we're successful to 15? Who knows? We'll move it up from there.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Maybe we'll see how the 15 goes, see\", \"completion\": \"how it goes the 15? Yeah, I'll see how that goes. You know, I'm hoping. And I hope this kind of makes sense that there'll be a point where you will be really interfering with the vast majority of the times that use marijuana. Like because you're giving yourself that many more opportunities, the longer you wait. Right. The more minutes you wait, the more opportunities for something else to get in the way so to speak. And probably what you'll see, just like you saw this last because you're, you know, you used marijuana less frequently, just by waiting the 10 minutes.

But then after that, it seems like as soon as I assure her of what we're doing, and when it's happening, when I'll be home, everything like that, it just seems like all the progress I made towards the front door kind of gets pulled back a little bit because like, she doesn't want me to leave, you know, I can see in her eyes that she's not very happy about me leaving her. And that kind of makes me feel guilty, you know, because I don't want to leave her alone. I want her to be more independent. I kind of want her to, you know, if I'm going out, I would like her to go out as well. You know, she says tons of friends. You know, we both have friends. We both have our social circles.

And I guess I don't always relay that well to her and she doesn't understand why I want my space. I want to go hang out with my friends, but I've been trying to explain to her that, you know, it's, it's a two way street. It's not just all one way and so we have to work on these issues.

And what happened. Same thing when, while you're out how many times you texted her If you called and then what happened when he got back? Right? That's just kind of, and you can you can keep a record of those things just independently. You know, you write it down Come your experience and you write down your experience.

And I'm really glad that you brought that point up, because I think that, given that we will run into each other quite a bit at the kindergarten, it's fine for us to acknowledge each other, but we do need to keep the therapeutic issues that we talk here in therapy for therapy.

So, say for instance, you had a percentile rank of 65% Right percentile, that would mean that your score is equal to or higher than 65% of people that took that test. Okay, so that makes sense. So if you took a test on math or English, and you would say 75 percentile, you'd be higher than three quarters of people took the test. 75% Okay, understand? Does that make sense? I think so. Okay. If you want me to come back to that later, just let me know as I go through if it doesn't make sense, okay. So areas here on on the SCL results, or you were a bit higher than we would normally see. A one is the phobic anxiety scale. on that one, you were about 64 percentile. So your score was as high or higher. Than 64% of people who take it \"}\n",

And I didn't realize this before, because I worked in an office. And I just realized that that's not what I want to do with my life. And I know what I want to do with my life now, and I've never known before. So this is an amazing feeling. And what I want to do is I want to start my own baking business. And so what happened was That a couple. Two weeks ago, my nephew had a bake sale. And I've always I've always been like baking, but I've always been like from the box or like from, you know, whatever. So I tried for the first time making brownies from scratch and they were amazing and everyone loved them at the bake sale and they sold out. And my nephew thought I was a hero, basically, I was and so now it made me realize like I could do this for a living and it would make me feel amazing and make me feel like a hero for all these people. And like my college campus would be kind of cool if I could like put up something about like delivering the bakery like the dorms or like big goods to dorms because you know, college students love that type of thing. But so anyway, so I was thinking about long story short, having this business and I would bake all these cookies and I was gonna put up flyers because I don't I'm not like at the point where I can get like an office space but I don't need an office space because I have my apartment and I have everything I need in my apartment to bake everything I need. And I can also have a BJs membership. So Go to BJs. And I can get everything I need in bulk. So like all the flour and butter and sugar and all that stuff. So it's not an issue if I just do it from my apartment. And so I was putting up flyers and trying to promote my business and has really been working on for the last week and a half, and I feel great. And it's amazing. And that's basically it.\", \"completion\": \"Alright, so you feel like, everything's kind of going your way. Hmm. And you're really excited about the new business idea.

So with the spending, like I don't think my brother recognizes that when you start a business like you need to invest in it to begin, and I understand why he's worried because like, so at work well at the office job that I had, like I got in trouble and because I obviously you need to make fires and I was like, oh, like he doesn't realize I'm frugal. I'm smart. So I was like I'll make the fires at work. And put them out of the work computer. So that I'm not having to pay like, wherever, like staples or something to go and print them out for me. So I got in trouble because it was like for personal use, and I was using like the, the work, whatever. But like that's what annoys me about it because like the new guy that I met, which is the other thing with the relationships, like this new guy is so supportive of my ideas. I met him actually in a bakery, which is like destiny. And he was so supportive when I told him about what I was planning. And actually the other guy that I was talking to before, and I've been talking to him for a while, he was kind of like my brother and was like, are you sure this is something you want to do? And like, I don't understand why you would say that someone who's obviously sure of what they want to do. Like, I know I can do it. I know that I'll be successful, like, did they not taste the brownies at the bake sale? Like they were amazing. And so that's kind of where I am and that's why my brother's worried but he shouldn't be because like I have all this played out.\", \"completion\": \"He's worried that you don't want to think this was the new relationship you don't know the guy too well\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"No. And like, he doesn't like, pay attention to me when I talk. Like, I'll be trying to tell him about, like the bake sale and or not the bake sale. Well, a little bit about the bake sale, I can try to tell him about how successful it was. And he just thought that I was like, bragging, but I wasn't like it was genuinely, like a success. And then I tried to tell him about my business idea. And like, he's like, trying to like brush it off. Like it's not a good idea. And that's why so he just doesn't listen to me.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah It's just there.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. And I'm curious, you mentioned you know, your friends are important to you and your family's important in sort of fitting in is important to you, and how does alcohol play a role with that? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Um, well, definitely not in my family life because my parents don't really condone, okay, alcohol use. But friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. \", \"completion\": \"Okay.  So from your family perspective, that Drinking is not something that fits very well. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And with friends, you feel like it's easier to to hang out with alcohol. Or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun or your friends wouldn't like you as much.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I guess it means this is just there.\", \"completion\": \"Okay\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"so it ties in with the whole belonging.\", \"completion\": \"Well, when you think about your drinking and sort of looking forward five years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It probably will have a very small role, if any, in my life considering I have big plans for my future. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school or in college or trying to get off school, things like that.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so the alcohol, something that might make it harder to reach your goals?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \" Yeah, definitely.\", \"completion\": \"So when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say when you get to college ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway. So maybe like one drink every once in a blue moon.\", \"completion\": \" Okay, so you sort of have a plan to cut back on your drinking eventually.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah definately\", \"completion\": \"how might that go?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school. And once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything bigger.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. So you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, definately that's a good thing.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all important, not something you're thinking about. And 10 is the most important thing, \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"maybe five or six.\", \"completion\": \"And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Because it's not something I do not care about it all but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. So It is something you have thought about.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I'm pretty confident that I can, considering that I'm not really an alcohol user, per se. I'm not really into that whole scene, so it's gonna be difficult for me.\", \"completion\": \"So what number do you think you'd say?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"On a scale of one to 10, If I can quit alchohol?\", \"completion\": \"Yeah\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"maybe like an eight or nine.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind. It sounds like you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustments and you're drinking at some point.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes.\", \"completion\": \" And it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself. And you actually feel very confident that you could be successful. With it, what sort of gold Do you think might be good to set for today?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Um, probably to stop. Maybe next Friday I go to I have a drink at all. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. Do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I mean, I can just tell my friends, my parent, my friends aren't really that pressuring. It's just like outside people that don't really know that well. So I could just tell them, Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.\", \"completion\": \"But what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Definitely, I'll have like, all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on.\", \"completion\": \"Uh huh. Anything else?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \" Um, health concerns? I guess I know, alcohol is bad for your health. So that would be one.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. So it's, it sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore, at least at the next party and seeing how it goes.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. Do you think it would be alright if we met again to kind of check in on how it goes and see if working out for you.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, that would be okay.\", \"completion\": \"All right, great. And then it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are health benefits and having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. Well, very good. Is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"How would you advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking?\", \"completion\": \"Oh, that's a great question. So a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back it's harder if their friends are still drinking. And one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol. But of course, that's harder if you're not doing planning. So some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends. Some of the things that I would recommend, since you're interested Are you know, carrying around Different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say without any alcohol mixed into it. Often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something. It kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, for sure.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it? Have you thought about how you might approach with them? Or is that something else you'd like some tips about about telling them about your plan to stop drinking?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I was just planning on playing them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That was me. Know, \", \"completion\": \"your friends would be pretty comfortable with that.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I mean, that was my closest friends for sure. \", \"completion\": \"Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else? I go?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \" No, I think okay. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. So then, like I said, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going. And then if things are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling blocks and we can maybe problem solve together. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Is that  Okay ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"All right. Thanks so much.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Definitely my dad. He's been on my case, like all week getting on me. It's been a real jerk in my room playing video games and talk to my friends and just barges into my room.

It's like, as soon as I wake up in the morning, you know, there's an email from or, you know, something, just tell me to do stuff I don't want to do. It doesn't get the, you know, I'm not feeling good. And I'm not gonna do that.\", \"completion\": \"So let me so let me interrupt you for just a second here. Make sure I understand you. You're really upset about your father getting on you this past week, right? Yeah.

You know, tell them something. write him a letter, I don't know, but something that could just get him to leave me alone.\", \"completion\": \"Well, one idea would be to get him to bring him in here and get him to back off, but he's not here right now. And maybe there's some things that you can do to help him calm down or back up the situation on\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"He's the one being a jerk.\", \"completion\": \"Well, that may be but maybe there's things you could do to be a little more assertive with him to let him know how you're feeling? Or perhaps to calm the  situation down.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't know. If you've got some ideas all listen, I guess. But\", \"completion\": \"okay, well, maybe we can put our heads together and come up with some strategies to deal with your dad a little bit better. All right. Is that suddenly? Is that something we could put down in the agenda then?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, no, that's okay. \", \"completion\": \"So I guess something really important that I would like to draw your attention to first of all, is this issue here of confidentiality, okay. Basically, everything that you and I talk about together in therapy is just between you and I, however, because I am a professional psychologist, the things that we discussed, I may need to share with my supervisor, okay. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, yeah, that's all right. Will it only be with your supervisor?\", \"completion\": \" Yeah, that's right. Yep. Yeah. There are a few special circumstances though, where I may have to break confidentiality. That is if you tell me that you might be of harm to yourself or someone else. Okay. If you tell me that you've been involved in a serious crime, okay for us. Somebody else wishes to access the information that we talked about in the context of legal proceedings and they take it off subpeona I'm required to give that information then okay. But of course, if any of these things ever did come up, I would discuss these with you first. Okay, that'd be good. Okay. All right. All right. So something else I just would like to draw your attention to here as well. It's just our fee here at the clinic. Yes. Which as we discussed on the phone is $20.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes. And that's fine. No problems.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. And I understand from time to time that things can come up as well and that you might have to reschedule one of your appointment. We just asked that if you could provide us with about 24 hours notice beforehand shot so that gives us a chance to be able to set up another appointment time.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, yeah, that's fine. No worries. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. Did you have any other questions about anything that you read on that shape there?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"I haven't, I'm feeling a little nervous. \", \"completion\": \"Yeah, I can understand that it can be a bit confronting and scary The first time you come along. Yeah. So I guess, I mean, just to give you a bit of an idea about how I like to work with clients, is that I like it to be a collaborative approach so that the two of us get to work together on new problems and concerns that you're having at the moment. Okay. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Sounds good.\", \"completion\": \"So the purpose of today's session, I guess, would be for me to get more of an understanding of what's happening for you lately. All right, and give us a chance to get to know each other a little bit more. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's really good. Yeah.

      "{\"prompt\": \"We never thought about that.\", \"completion\": \"I don't know how many bullet points you'd have in a presentation. Maybe you'd have 10 or 20. Yeah, depending on how long right so maybe you as you start to review a certain bullet point As you're trying to get it into your memory and think about it, you breathe in really deeply. And then as you continue on, you just let out that breath really slowly,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"like a rhythm sort of, huh? Yeah. Can you go and do the same thing?\", \"completion\": \" I thought about it that way. I'm just thinking it'd be some way to structure. So you would, you would get in so many breaths,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"something I wouldn't forget. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah, something that kind of becomes a habit. Okay. Just make sure you keep your bullet points of length. About a few paragraphs. Yeah. But just just a few seconds each. So you can get a good deep breath and, or you could, you know, if you did have a longer bullet point, you could have obviously, several breaths, but just some rhythm that you could kind of grab on to something concrete. Yeah. Because I know that. In that moment, things are probably like you mentioned zoning out and right It becomes very easy to lose your anchors.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, exactly. And just get really foggy, almost dizzy.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah, so if you can remember, you know, for a particular bullet point that you want to take three deep breaths.

When's the next presentation in that class that's coming up?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"I'm like 15 or so.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, it's a little shorter than 20 minutes. So you have about a half hour, maybe a little more, if there's time to switch out of kind of sitting there, right. And potential time where you could be anxious. Yes, but also potential time and you could be reviewing the notes your bullet points and breathing.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And saying to yourself, that's so like, kind of self talk, that they're not really paying attention to me anyway. Right. Right. Because that might help reduce that. That anxiety. Yeah. What's one thing you could say to yourself when you're up there?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I guess I could say that, you know, in general, I do pretty well. You know, one bad grade as in going to war. Make me doesn't mean that I don't deserve to be here.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so the sort of self talk up there could be I deserve to be here.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Maybe I've prepared enough, you know that I know that I've prepared. And I'm a good student. Okay.\", \"completion\": \"I've prepared enough. I'm a good student. I deserve to be here.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Is that something that would be helpful to write down and have as part of your notes that you can?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I think it would actually, I can recite that.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah, internally as you because it's not long.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \" I think I could, it will be easy to remember. And I could just like maybe put it down on one of my note cards in front of me or something.\", \"completion\": \"And how much do you believe that those statements are true?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I think you know, sitting now, sitting here now I believe them in the moment sometimes it's a little hard to believe because I convinced myself otherwise. But I think I actually believe that that that that's true. They deserve to be in the program.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so there's those self talk items. You believe them to be true. Yeah, but you recognize in the moment, and I want you to be aware of this. You might not believe them as much, right? But remember that, you know, we worked on them. Right? You came up with them.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. \", \"completion\": \"And you believe them now. Right? So try to keep that in your mind as you start to doubt yourself. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. It's easy. I realize it's easy to form these plans. Right.\", \"completion\": \"Then the chaos of anxiety in the words is harder. So the more tasks you can make concrete, and you can write down and you can rehearse, I think the better off you'll be. Okay. I would like to see you your presentations next Friday. Yeah, I would like to see you right before that. So be about a week. Okay for that. Do you have any questions? These are items you can rehearse still even without the presentation, the self talk and write the breathing, and of course preparing. But you have any questions between now and then you think?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't think so I think it makes sense. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Understand kind of the plan to attack that anxiety symptom\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"And I think you know, what you kind of suggested before, like, maybe practicing my deep breathing. Like maybe now, like when I'm calm and getting into a habit of deep breathing, like, I'm more apt to also remember it, then.\", \"completion\": \"Right. So, so good. So you have some kind of behavioral pieces. Focus on studying the breathing. And so cognitive pieces that the self talk we talked about, yeah. That you use when you're seated and use when you're at the podium,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right\", \"completion\": \"And actually presenting. Alright, good. So I'm glad we have a plan going forward. I think that you did a really good job today, helping kind of untangle this and figure out what's going on. And I appreciate that. You were able to really connect with the symptoms and the thoughts and kind of realize how they're related. Yeah. And I feel like this is something that's going to serve you well as you move through this. \"}\n",

Yeah, just more layers and all black says you just can't tell.\", \"completion\": \"Okay What do you think would happen if you stopped doing these things? If you stopped gripping onto the camera?

Yeah, I think I just would just check even more and be more anxious and look of more obviously, kind of weird and out of place.\", \"completion\": \"And what I'm thinking now is how do you feel about if we did an experiment to test out your thoughts on what would happen if you stopped doing these things? If we did a bit of a role play where we pretended to enact a situation at work, okay?

Okay\", \"completion\": \"so the first column says, I need to fill out an experiment to test this thought that you have, so that our experiment is going to be that we do a conversation at work, and who should I play if you're playing yourself in this roleplay?

And are you interested in having things outside maybe and he said it was he wants to It's been natural.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah, cuz it's gonna be a summer wedding and Okay, you know, weather dependent.

Ryan's gonna give you this back now to look up. Okay. And I just want you to watch that. Okay. And then we'll chat about it in a moment. Okay.\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Definitely not as much as I thought. I think it's obvious that I'm obviously quite anxious, but I don't think you can tell them shaking that much.\", \"completion\": \"So you said that you were going to shake 90 out of 100? How much shaking Would you say that you saw there?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"And maybe like, less than 30.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. And you said that you were going to go red, or pink as pink as these chairs? 90 out of 100. Did you notice yourself going pink?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Not really. Actually, definitely less than I thought. Yeah, not as much.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, you said that you were worried that you were going to say something stupid, you know, at 90 out of 100 Did you know yourself say anything stupid?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Not really. Yeah. Yeah, thought was gonna be a lot worse than\", \"completion\": \"actually it was. So you thought you were going to be like 90 say something that was 90% stupid. That's really quite strong. I mean, in the end did you pick up in Anything that could be maybe put that as a zero?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Maybe like, less than 10 maybe.\", \"completion\": \"And you said that you thought you were going to be sweating? Yeah. And that you're going to be visibly sweating. Did you? Did you notice yourself sweating in the end?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Not really. Definitely not as bad as I\", \"completion\": \"thought again, you thought you were going to be like night out, like seriously visibly sweating. So what what score would you actually give it in the end?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Maybe again, less than 10 I don't think you could tell at all.\", \"completion\": \"Mm hmm. You also said that you thought it was going to be twice as bad when you stop choosing your you know your normal strategies.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"What did you notice watching that video?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It was actually probably better when I wasn't doing any of those things. I think I looked a lot more natural. And I was able to say what I was trying to say. I think it just come across more personable when I'm not kind of looking down and stuff.\", \"completion\": \"okay that's all for now. Thank you so much for your time\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Terrible, it would feel like, you know, I had a role in that kind of thing happening to somebody, like I was partially to blame for somebody being harmed. And that is like the exact opposite of what my job is supposed to be.\", \"completion\": \"So that would be a worst case outcome. You would be extremely upset. You're extremely upset now. While you're five out of 10 right now, but you're an eight when you're in bed in the morning. Yeah. Is it reasonable that a professional makes a mistake like that? This is the mistake of kind of missing something that normally would be caught. Is it reasonable? They continue on in the field and try to learn from that.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't know, I mean, I'd like to think that I guess it's not possible to make that kind of mistake, but I think that that's naive. I think it is possible. And I, I would like to learn from that, but I don't know what other people would do. Like I don't know if I would lose my job or anything.\", \"completion\": \"Right, there might be consequences for that type of error. It's not intentional, something that like many mistakes would happen due to conflict confluence of circumstances who being tired of being the end of the day, not being honest. There's mitigation there. But still, I can appreciate you would want to make that mistake either way. What would your after making a mistake like that? What would your thought be? Would you be thinking?\"}\n",

I don't know how I'm ever gonna feel okay about what I did.\", \"completion\": \"To my extension, I'll never feel okay about what I did. Yeah. And what do you think you would do then in terms of your reaction to that thought?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't know. I mean, I guess ideally, I would say to myself, it's going to get better. You know, this will pass and everything but I don't know. It's just hard.\", \"completion\": \"What do you think would do to your performance?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I think I would probably Take some time off. I mean, it's just like I would be so stressed afterwards. And worried I would make another mistake because I'm so stressed out and having trouble focusing.\", \"completion\": \"So in a strange way, the anxiety, the thoughts you're having now that result in anxiety, are leaving you more at risk to make a mistake.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I mean, I guess I never thought about it like that, although that makes a lot of sense. Like it. If I, if I just calm down and try to let it go, then I'll do my job better and I won't have that risk as much. But if I keep feeling like this, I'm not focusing and then I could make a bigger mistake because of it.\", \"completion\": \"Right, so one of the thoughts you're having now is you can't make a mistake because it would be too devastating. And that titles like this. I have a thought you're having. So it's like you can't make a mistake.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, yeah, because when I take them, I feel normal. Like, it makes me feel like I can function. And I feel normal.

I'm just not. I'm not on my game the way I used to be. And I know that there is a connection to the drugs.\", \"completion\": \"So in terms of concentrating, focusing?\"}\n",

I can I don't know, I'm completely what to do \", \"completion\": \"And this is tough for you. The Percocet makes you feel normal. I would talk about this before. Yeah, it used to give you high, but not anymore.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No, right. It is not fun.\", \"completion\": \"But it makes you feel normal.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"And we've talked about the detox options.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh god no.no no no, \", \"completion\": \"it's not something that you want. So really, what's changed to make things more difficult is that you're worried that your coworkers are on to you. Right. And it's your performance in terms of focusing on on your accounting work has been compromised as well. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"is that right ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. And when you put it that way, she's definitely noticed it and she talks to so it's not like she's if she thinks something's up. With me, she's going to keep it to herself. So that would be the reputation piece and then also, the quality of my work. I know it's, it's not the same, it's a lot harder for me to produce what I used to.\", \"completion\": \"And you're afraid that's going to be noticed as well?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, for sure. But I can't take detox, there's it's just not an option.\", \"completion\": \"Alright. Let's talk about I want to do some scaling work. I want to talk about the importance of this change to you know, cuz we've been talking about this change for a while\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"that change, like giving up the Percocet. \", \"completion\": \"Yeah. Let's talk about, let's just talk about the importance of it though. So just focus on that one narrow piece. Okay, we're just we're just talking about how important it is. So on a scale of one to 10, with one being not important at all, and 10 being extremely important. How important is it to you that you that you can make this change? Can you make this change?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"See, I go back and forth. I don't know that it's that important. Well, if I lose my job, that would be horrible. So maybe it is pretty important. I mean, it's important that I keep my job. It's really important that I keep my job, and then it keeps my reputation.\", \"completion\": \"Well, so it's important that you keep your job and that importance, in a sense now appears to be tied to the importance of not using Percocet. They've been tied together a little bit, right.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, because to get out of bed, yeah. Okay.\", \"completion\": \"So if you if you if you had to pick a number one to 10, or 10 is extremely important. How important is it to you to make the change?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"7     8     7.\", \"completion\": \"7 so fairly important.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Alright, eight. I mean, I got to keep it up.\", \"completion\": \"You have to keep it up?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So let's talk about another construct. That's important.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"I want to talk about confidence. So using that same scale, how confident are you that you can beat the Percocet?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"That's what I've been trying to do for how long have I been coming in here?\", \"completion\": \"About about six months now.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I've tried I mean, I have really tried. I know I can't I don't I don't. I don't think I can do it.\", \"completion\": \"So it was in the one to 10 scale. What do you think you would be?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Like 0   1 I can't. I've been trying.\", \"completion\": \"So very low confidence, nope really no confidence. You have no confidence. You have no confidence that you can change and it's very important to you that you do change. So this is a real bind the trend. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, it's pretty depressing.\", \"completion\": \"You mentioned that one of the reasons your confidence is low is because you tried over the last six months and working with me and you've not been successful at stopping the Percocet use.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I'll leave here swearing to myself. I'm done. You know that next week I'm going to come in and I'm going to tell you that I didn't use at all and then like before, I'm in bed. I've already taken some you know that night.\", \"completion\": \"So it's easy to see where the low confidence rating comes in. Based on your experiences the last six months. How about other times when you've been able to make a tough change? If you look through your, your past and different experiences, has there been any other occasions where you have been successful, beating something like this and making a tough change?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, yeah, I mean, I used to I used to with the gambling I guess, I I used to hit Delaware Park, you know, on a regular basis and spent a lot of money and my husband was pretty upset about it and I had a really hard time stopping that. \", \"completion\": \"So that was those tough that was. Would you say that you felt addicted to gambling?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"We Oh yeah, definitely.\", \"completion\": \"And it was painful to stop. Are you happy that you did stop?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh, God, I would never want to go back to that. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So when you were in the middle of that addiction of gambling, right, how likely to seem that you would be able to stop back then?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, that's that's a really good point. I didn't think that I was going to be able to say probably about a to two or three. \", \"completion\": \"So there's some parallels here between what happened with the gambling and with what's happening now the Percocet.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I didn't think about it that way. So I really didn't think I could do it then and it's been, you know, a couple years since I've even been in a casino.\", \"completion\": \"So you would say you were successful at beating that addiction?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, definitely.\", \"completion\": \"Definitely success, so what happened? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It's so different. It's different. It's so different. Oh my god. Let's talk about that. Just like I just find myself popping them in my mouth. You know.\", \"completion\": \"So the mechanism is different. Like for the gambling, you'd have to drive to the casino to drive Delaware Park. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"You'd have to have money\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right, Right. \", \"completion\": \"Whereas the the percocets so easy. Yeah that you get them for my friends.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And it's a lot easier to consume and Percocet than to get in your car and make the time and so the mechanism is different.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"But wonder if there's any similarities with this? Well, with the success and the potential success, meaning you you thought that you could never stop gambling, you think that you could never get through detox?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I didn't think about detox, but you're right. It was miserable in that period when I first stopped kind of casino and I felt that really strong urge to go. And I made it through that, my husband was amazing.\", \"completion\": \"You husband was supportive?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh yeah, he was really great. He would sit with me he would talk me through it. We go to movies sweet, you now he was really encouraging. Probably be really happy to see me stop using these Percocet too.\", \"completion\": \"So as you reflect on your confidence, and this is not something you necessarily need to do right now. It's probably important to consider that you were successful before in the past. All the circumstances were different. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"But you gained too high from that gambling.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"that was it was addictive?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"and and you beat it and it and it was hard it was challenging but you also have a supportive husband. Would you have your support your husband if you tried to stop Percocet?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh, yeah. Yeah. He He's really, you know, upset, by the way, and I'm taking them and he's really worried about me losing the job. I don't see why he wouldn't be able to help me in the same way, I guess.\", \"completion\": \"Well, since this since stopping is important to you, but your confidence is low. But this might be a good area to kind of process which is, you know, you do have the supports in place, and you have successfully defeated addiction before. So it's something to consider, as you weigh, you know, I know that detox is something you've expressed really clearly that you're not a big fan of and I can appreciate your reasons. At the same time, get support, you don't lose your job. So, let's do this. Let's, between now and when I see you next, maybe reflect on some of the strengths and supports and the past successes you've had. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"And see if we can accurately factor those into this equation. Right as you're processing through and and considering a very tough decision. So it makes sense?\"}\n",

Maybe whatever illness I have is making me feel this way.\", \"completion\": \"So you believe you have a physical illness?\"}\n",

Sounds like there's been a lot of stressors and lots of change over the last year. Yeah. Sam status moved away, which is kind of created some changes in finances, which have led to, maybe not always having the food or the clothing that you've needed or that Sam has needed. You've got, your mom has moved in, and there's some stress and tension and arguing that's happening in that. And you've also told me that maybe all of these stressors and stuff have contributed to Sam not feeling as loved or as cared for. On the other hand, it sounds like you're managing emotionally and that you're not using any drugs or alcohol. You have told me that there are no concerns regarding physical, emotional or sexual abuse. For Sam and his life, and that nobody in your family more in Sam's life has gone to prison. So I think you're right there is likely a connection between kind of what's happening for Sam in school and the difficulties that he's starting to have with all of these stresses and changes at home.

Like I just, it wasn't deserved, and I just felt like such a loser because I should have that was the time that I should have been at work. If I had a job and instead I was at the bar drinking.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"completion\": \"what now\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, now I just kind of I don't I'm afraid to go back like I'm afraid to go out with, like some friends. They invite me out to dinner. But I know there's alcohol. And\", \"completion\": \"is that where you were when that first strike? was out with friends?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So there's a few things going on. We've talked in the past, right about separating the behavior from the person. Right? So, behavior is what we do, not who we are. You remember those discussions? And correct me if I'm wrong with sounds like I'm using different words than you use. But it sounds like when you had that first drink, you're kind of ashamed that you had a drink and you had it during the time when you would have been working.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, that's pretty accurate.\", \"completion\": \"That's pretty accurate. All right. So taking yourself kind of back to that moment. All right, we we had that first. That first drink like you finished that first drank What was your What was your thought at that at that moment?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Just like shameful. Like I did really, really well. And then here I was. I just finished a drink and I knew I wanted another one. \", \"completion\": \"Okay, so shameful is kind of like the feeling. But the thought is I did really, really well. Right?  So that's what your thinking was. I did really, really well. And what? was that the end of the thought, or was that was there more before you had that next trick?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I guess just I was doing well. And then I had a drink and I just felt like an awful person. So I figured what was the hurt Having more\", \"completion\": \"sort of sequence would have been you had to drink. You felt shameful. At the same time you're thinking that you were doing really well. And then just really, as you said before, you just felt like a loser. And then you decided, might as well just have the second drink. So another thought might be that, like, I might just have a second drink.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, \", \"completion\": \"yeah. So you can see others some thoughts and some feelings at work. right as you finish that first drink was a fairly quick, but those thoughts feelings fairly. occur fairly quickly after the drink.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, absolutely. As I was finishing and then finished,\", \"completion\": \"so right away, you regret it and that regret As you thought about it, don't might as well just just continue drinking now, because you kind of blew it.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I already messed up, I might as well keep going. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. And that's a common cycle to fall into. And you had three weeks, we hadn't had a drink prior to that. So let's, let's look at this. Let's try to separate the behavior from the self a little bit. If you had if you had a friend who was in the same predicament, right, you had a history of using alcohol and then at three weeks, without any alcohol use, and then their behavior was to have a drink. What would you think of them?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I think that they had a rough day or something was to happen where I mean, it's just wondering,\", \"completion\": \"I had a rough day one drink, and what would you think of their behavior? How would you categorize that behavior?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"That's just they made a mistake.\", \"completion\": \"So not ideal, depending on their point of view, maybe a little irresponsible.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I think irresponsible,\", \"completion\": \"irresponsible, but you wouldn't necessarily characterize them as a bad person. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No.\", \"completion\": \"But their behavior was a bit of responsible.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"You know, in terms of like the recovery plan, which would be to not drink. But when you apply that same example examination to your own situation, how do you characterize yourself after you had that first drink?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It was my mistake it was in it. It makes me a worse person for doing it.\", \"completion\": \"So you see how you're you're being a little bit quite a bit rougher on yourself. Like your your evaluation of yourself is, is fairly harsh. You mentioned loser earlier and ashamed. Whereas you wouldn't necessarily evaluate someone else that way.  How would you evaluate your behavior? How would you How would you judge your behavior taking that first drink?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"shameful. I mean, irresponsible, which is bad overall.\", \"completion\": \"So, so bad, irresponsible, shameful. Is there a way to separate that behavior in terms of in terms of your thinking, the way you evaluate it from yourself, like are you into behavior? together a meshed or can you be separated?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I think we could be separated But it, it feels like we're like I am that behavior\", \"completion\": \"in that moment. It's very congruent for you.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes, \", \"completion\": \"the shame matches the behavior to behavior matches shame. Like it's there one at that moment. Mm hmm. But really, logically, rationally, you're you, Ryan, your identity and values and your behavior, something you do. But in the moment, it's hard for you to see that. Mm hmm. Looking back on it now is are you able to see the distinction between what people do and what they are?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah I mean, just because you have one drink doesn't make you a horrible person and\", \"completion\": \"no, certainly not. And you were, you were clean for three weeks, and you had one drink. So really, your behavior was a slip. Right It was and irresponsible in relationship to your goals, I suppose. But still a slip. And you could have stopped. But that shame got ahold of you. Right. I thought, well, now I've done it. I blew it. Yeah. So with that mentality, you kind of set yourself up for drinking more. So, I think this is important because we've seen this cycle like where you have weeks of sobriety, and then we'll drink a bit and then have weeks as writing. And I'm wondering if part of the difficulty you're facing is you're not coping with the slips as just slips\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"okay.\", \"completion\": \"You're allowing them to be gateways into a lot more drinking than the slip. Does that make sense? That That's pretty accurate. And you see how the shameful feelings kind of just interfere with the behavior that you really want that's really consistent with their goals, which would be to not continue drinking. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Mm hmm.\", \"completion\": \"Another piece of this too is the association associating with friends who drink, you're putting yourself in a treacherous situation. Again, that's a behavior. Right? That doesn't make you one way or the other. It's a behavior. How would you judge that behavior going out with friends?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't know. I mean, difficult because I like being around those people. But I guess it would be it's risky.\", \"completion\": \"risky, okay. It's a risky behavior. And what does it make you Who are you? Because you do that behavior. Like how do you feel about yourself? When you take that risky, behavior, \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"guilty, \", \"completion\": \"okay So you have guilt when you go out with your friends. And then you have shame if you drink. And both, in this case, both emotions that kind of point you in the direction of more drinking. So part of this behavioral strategy here is to avoid the circumstances like to recognize that's a risky behavior, which you have. And the other part would be to deal more effectively if you do slip away, right. Does that does that separation of what we do and who we are? makes sense to rationally?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"kind of\", \"completion\": \"feels a little unnatural, though.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So maybe, as you're confronting similar situations in the course of the next week, You could be aware of behaviors that might put you at risk, and try to try to separate your identity from that behavior. So, so just judge the behavior. Okay. Right. And don't don't pass any judgment on yourself. So that makes sense.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Kind of Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"It might help you to. Since it's a little tough to because right now, the feeling and the judgment, retro twined. Right. It might help to write down when these things happen, and kind of write down like, like one row for this is how I judge this behavior. But I'm thinking about doing and this is how I judge myself. So if you see a lot of self judgment, that might be a clue that you're falling into a cycle a little bit,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"where you're making decisions based on that emotion instead of a rational judgment and behavior.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay, \", \"completion\": \"that helped a little bit.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I think that would probably be beneficial.\", \"completion\": \"So that'll be our plan going forward.  Until next week is note document your judgment about your behavior, any judgment you may have about yourself. Right, and there's some insight that can be gained there. Right. Kind of distinguish the two and making those and try to use that evidence before making a decision to might put you in a risky spot. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Sound like plan?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I think I can try that.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, good. I'll see you next week. And we'll see how you did with those goals.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Good.\", \"completion\": \"What's been going on?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Been a little anxious about a shopping habit that I have\", \"completion\": \"talk about that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes, Well, I have to buy everything in pairs or in twos. And if I only have one thing I won't buy it I'll put it back or I'll look around the store for another thing so that I have two things to buy.Y\", \"completion\": \"So when you go into store, if you just have one thing you want to buy one item you went there for you will buy a second item or even more just Second,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"sometimes it can be more as long as it's reached the minimum of two.\", \"completion\": \"So you have to leave having purchased a minimum of two, right? Or if you can't find something else, you won't buy it at all. Exactly. So So zero would also be acceptable.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Zero would be acceptable.\", \"completion\": \"But one, \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"no, no, no, I can't do just one guy can't do one. Okay. Now, it's got to be two or more.\", \"completion\": \"And what happens that has ever been the occasion where you've only purchased one thing?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I can't really remember one. I'm sure there has been but I can't really remember one.\", \"completion\": \" So for all this period of time, you have successfully either purchase nothing, or two or more items.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh, yeah. I have to it's very anxiety producing if I don't know\", \"completion\": \"how anxiety producing\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"it, I just feel like something bad will happen. If I don't keep it to two or more.\", \"completion\": \"You know, what would happen? give a specific.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, for example, like my family would be in a car accident, or I would hit deer or you know, get fired from my job.\", \"completion\": \"So something really, really bad will happen. This is hurtful for you. This is causing you pain. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes.\", \"completion\": \"And this would happen. This would really happen on any shopping trip where you just want one thing you'd be reminded, so if you went in wanting more than one thing, it's not a problem, right?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It's if I only really need one thing And then I can't just buy that one thing that I need.\", \"completion\": \"Alright, so how often does this happen? Where you are in a situation where you want to make a purchase of just one item? And you have to you have to change because the anxiety \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"daily,\", \"completion\": \"daily?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah, because I mean, if I go grocery shopping or if I go clothes shopping or for any kind of money transactional thing, you know, which I would encounter daily pretty much it happens\", \"completion\": \"I would like fill up your car gasoline.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh then oh bipac accom.\", \"completion\": \"So it has an effect that level two.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So you're thinking it almost like the number of transactions has to be more than one. I mean, it has to be two or zero.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. No. Or vitamins or number of transactions? Yeah. Because see if I get gas, then I have the gas in my car. That's the thing.\", \"completion\": \"That's one transaction and one thing and one thing, okay. And then. Okay, so that's one product, right? And you need another product. Right? So you really can't feel your car without going inside the station. Store.\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Exactly. Yes.\", \"completion\": \"So I could see now this, this would be more of a daily thing. You said, Right. Yeah. Because at first I was thinking daily. That's a lot of individual shopping trips, but it applies to all transaction. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Exactly. Yeah. I did really realize that that way. But it does. Yeah. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So this is a fairly significant source of anxiety for you.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes, it is. It does. Pr I get, you know, like, builds up in me and I feel it.\", \"completion\": \"So let's talk about that. And help me to understand this better. So let's say that you went to a convenience store, and just had one thing in mind, what might be a potential item that you would gum? gum, right? So you want to go in and you just want to buy a pack of gum. That's all you really want. That's why you stopped at the store. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \" So you go in, you have any thoughts? Now we talked in the past about automatic thoughts, these thoughts just kind of come in, right. So are there any thoughts in there happening when you're walking into the store?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I start. I start with what do I need? Why am I here? You know, I need a pack of gum. And then it's instant anxiety that what else am I gonna get? What else can I get to make it the two?\", \"completion\": \"All right. So the thought is What else can I get? Yeah, like this one, the past will be two has to be two. It has to be two. That's not that's Yeah. So that's also possible more demanding. Yeah. So it has to be.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. So I guess the first thought is what else? What else do I have to get? Yeah. And then so jumps right\", \"completion\": \"to the anxiety. So is the anxiety\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It starts going down. Okay,\", \"completion\": \"so it's really gradually\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes, but it is really it is really Yes. Once it completely gone. When I'm done that\", \"completion\": \"Alright, so you so really the the worst anxiety would be approaching the store entering in that moment of uncertainty. When you don't know the second Yeah,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"absolutely. All right.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. So if you could relieve that anxiety, that would be one of your goals. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"That would be fantastic. Fantastic.\", \"completion\": \"All right. So let's think about this way. Do you? Do you know the reason that you do this? You have any guesses?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I would guess that. I mean, we've talked about you my dad had some bad experiences I had I sound awful. Yeah, they've, they were difficult. So I wonder if that's not somehow linked to this behavior somehow. Being impossibly\", \"completion\": \"Alright. So you've been through some really tough times to put it mildly.

Now we, we, we talked before, we're talking about cognitive therapy, about useful and less than useful thoughts, right? functional and less functional or dysfunctional. thoughts.

By buying to or failing to buy to write in the store, or wherever you make the transaction, different story. So you have, let's, let's go a different direction. I talked about how you walk into a store, and you think, well, I get those the phone, right? And you end up getting something else. Yes, the anxiety then kind of goes away. And we'll come up the next time that happens. But it's a way it's gone for that moment. So, I want you to kind of stay with me as I go through another scenario.

We're good. How much you're feeling right now? very anxious, right? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Are you worried is the kind of anxiety where you're worried that something catastrophic is gonna happen?

Yeah, wherever it is leave. So what are the possible things that could happen? Knowing that logically you can connect it to a safety thing, and you might be anxious about that. And that's real, that anxiety is real. But knowing that the event isn't prevented or caused by exactly the transacting behavior. Let's go through what happens. So you buy the coffee. You're really anxious. Right? up to it, you're anxious to go into driving there either.\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"It could be I would get old. I think the anxiety would get exhausted.\", \"completion\": \"So really, what you're doing is you're conditioning you'd be conditioning yourself right to, to to surviving just buying the one item. I have a lot more money financial advantages to it certainly. And there'd be a you know what I hope is a freedom advantage which is the freedom to buy any number of miners, the next so what what scenario of purchasing i know i i asked for the coffee example I mean I asked one thing you're going to buy the coffee, but what what scenario could you see yourself being most likely to fall through this? I don't know if the coffee is the optimal situation for that behavior experiment maybe I guess it would there be another item that would be easier to actually fall through like for example, the gasoline because you'd get your car by the gasoline and you leave. Yeah, that would be easier for you. You will be tempted by the other I\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"That would be much easier. Okay.\", \"completion\": \"So we will, we will consider that kind of a step in a direction that would result in fewer symptoms. Yeah, that would be wonderful. And maybe another step in the future if we get there. So it goes with us, but it would be to go into the store and buy one but let's not let's not do that. Okay. Let's stick with the gasoline.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay. I feel more confident about that.\", \"completion\": \"You feel like you could succeed with that. Yeah, experiment.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"We'll see when we actually get there, but yes, I would like to. I feel like I could actually try that. More so than the coffee. So\", \"completion\": \"are you afraid with the coffee that you might just end up buying too? Okay.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes.\", \"completion\": \"So how's your anxiety now?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I feel better than I don't have to just buy one cup of coffee.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so that was a stressor.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"But I feel it's it's miles. But but okay. But it was.\", \"completion\": \"But mostly because the experiment that we're talking about somewhat easier\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"And because I think like the insight that you gave me on, I hadn't connected the safety security, I hadn't connected all the dots. So that was very helpful.\", \"completion\": \"So one of the we talked about before, what do I mag thoughts like adaptive responses, right. So as you're trying to kind of push through this experience of just feeling car, you're going to have those thoughts still come up. And the adaptive response could be something like, Well, I'd like you to design it or work with me and design it. But could be something like, I know this will actually have a consequence in the real world. Yeah, I realized this is just how responding internally doesn't take away the anxiety, necessarily. It might, but it will help you maybe get through that process. Yeah. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah, absolutely. There's a few things I'm asking you to do. Right. One is to just buy gasoline needed and only by gasoline. And at the same time when those thoughts come up to respond to them with the adaptive responses to compare the two.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, gotcha. \", \"completion\": \"Apparently got it. Right. So I know this won't have real consequence. In reality, that could be one. And if you have any others, you know, you can apply to as well as apply them. I know that I can tolerate the anxiety. Yeah, seems like you've tolerated for a long time. It's not pleasant. It's not what you want. But you can tolerate.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And maybe another adapter response would be, this is painful for me. But if I can be successful here, if I can get rid of things,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah. The longer term picture Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And keeping your island moving up to coffee and other other behavioral goals. Like that. Yeah, that makes sense.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I like that a lot.\", \"completion\": \"So we're kind of attacking anxiety from a lot of different angles here. Okay?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So do you do believe that you can succeed with this idea?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I do. It's been a long time. But I that I mean, the behaviors and the thought processes have been in place for a long time. So I think it'll be a challenge but i think you know, it's time\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. So well, that can be very Positive so that you know what I detected there was, you're ready to challenge the six idea. Right? Like, I would like to take the devil's courage. Yeah, yeah. So you're ready to say I've had enough. And you can see a clear path of behavior that can help you get through it and you're ready to take the anxiety on. That can be a positive adaptive response, right? Like being assertive and saying, almost like you're talking to the anxiety in a way okay, right, but I'm not gonna let you beat me this time. That's what you'd be saying to the anxiety.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I like that one. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So, make a note of all these right? And you can use the same one more than once. You can mix them up, whatever works for you. Okay, but keep applying them as needed through the whole process into your home, your is your no more risk to go by. It's great. Yeah. Cuz it because I think once you get home really, that's, that's the completion of only participating that one transaction right, you've left and go back to restarting the cycle. So right. you've, you've permanently recorded just buying the one thing. Yeah, so that's a victory. Yeah. That'd be a huge victory. So I don't know if you know the status of your gas tank right now. Do you foresee needing to get gas between now and next week?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh, yeah, you do? need to do that. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So if you could try that out. And if you could record kind of in the moment, like after it's over the experience in terms of your feelings, different stages, that would be helpful. \"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Well, sometimes sometimes sometimes after a 12 hour shift, yes, I have one of them. She won't show me let me sleep the first hour, she literally were around again and stuff. And I take it and she's mad because I've been gone, but she's fine.\", \"completion\": \"She continues to survive, despite being perhaps upset with you for leaving. So that could be another adaptive response that they may be enduring a mild stressor. But sometimes they're asleep when you get home. So \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah, that's true.\", \"completion\": \"how bad could it be for them?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. And they don't know. I'm worrying or anxious. They could care less like they don't believe no, it's not bothering them. I mean,\", \"completion\": \"yeah, I mean, their level awareness clearly different than than yours. Right. So yeah, I mean, that's another good adaptive response that, you know, much higher level awareness, whereas you're not sure that Have any awareness that you're experiencing anxiety? Or maybe a little bit with a one cat who runs or think they do? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"And that's just an animal person but I think they do but yeah, I probably give them think they have more feelings than what they probably really do. But they're my kids I treat them as kids my kids are all gods are important too. Yeah,\", \"completion\": \"absolutely. So it's understandable that you would be anxious and have concerns and but it also seems like you did make preparations to elevate their chances of having a successful experience right being okay.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So you implement behaviors that are practical and that I've worked in making the house safe and keeping the plants away from them and so I think one route here if you're okay with it would be to use work as like the first point I know you have the trip. I know that's, that appears to be causing more anxiety than thinking the worst But you have more chances? Well, one way you have more chances to test out these step responses at work because it's more or less a daily thing, right? five days a week, or whatever it is. So some of those adaptive responses that we kind of worked on together, right? You could apply those. And you know, think about that the responses are not always short. Right? The automatic thoughts could be short. It can even be images, do not necessarily even complete sentences, right? Like maybe have an image of your cat in an unfortunate situation. So it's not necessarily spelled out in English, like a sentence, but adaptive responses. Well, they could be images too, but the ones I'm talking about are really sentences that you're repeating back consciously to yourself. So it's important to have them prepared and ready to go. So I often ask clients To kind of write them out and have them available. So that when that thought comes about, and it seems like you're pretty good at identifying, you know, what thoughts are triggering anxiety you would read eventually would have to read because you've memorized initially you'd read the automatic thought I mean, the upside of the adaptive response and that would counter the deal on that thought. Okay, might not the first time might not the second time but over time we believe it and I found that it changes how often and how intense to aback thoughts come in. Conscious thinking, adaptive responding, does that make sense?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"That's us. Because like I said, I kind of said these things to myself anyway, I just didn't realize that's what was probably lessening the anxiety because I do say that things those things to myself pretty frequently when I say I have to go to work, or else you guys won't be able to take care of didn't even dawned on me that that's\", \"completion\": \"you've already adapted Yeah, you've already used cognitive behavioral techniques, in a way to reduce anxiety. So what we're really doing is just expanding and formalizing what you've already been doing to achieve some success.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"That makes sense. Definitely, yes.\", \"completion\": \"So, if you could, between now and next session, write down some of the adaptive responses that we discussed the ones you've already used and, and then work to identify the automatic thoughts at work, and then come up, work to identify them, and then consciously repeat those, those that the responses back when you have those thoughts, okay, so you're really repairing self talk, adaptive responses, with the automatic thoughts, that thought comes right? And then you have the adaptive response. And you're repeating it, you know, it's an internal, you're pitting and just thinking it unnecessarily odds out loud, although, that would surely be okay to not know, your coworkers, you know, respond something like that.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Sorry. No. I mean, I've threatened to put a camera in the house. So I can like, there's a thing you can, you can remote access to your house, and there's a button your animal can push and call you. And I've talked to him at work. I'm like, Well, my cat calls me y'all. I really thought about it seriously, that I could check one that would lessen my anxiety would have to go home, I could just look in and see what they're doing. I have thought that some of my co workers know I can't worry about them. So yeah, they would help support me and not be so anxious. Probably.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. And and putting in a security type measure. You could lessen anxiety, or it could create anxiety,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"but make it worse,\", \"completion\": \"and I don't know which, you know. So I think if you're okay with it, we'll start with the adaptive responses. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I'd rather do that. \", \"completion\": \"See how that works out. And we have other options. Putting security systems in such to shy out in the future if necessary. Let's try the adaptive responding. Then trying to keep track of how well it works for you like, what your what your thoughts and feelings were. After you applied it,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"should I like try to measure my level of anxiety? Absolutely. Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. So you know, maybe like a one to 10 with 10 being the worst, okay, and measure it when you first had that experience of it. I'm pretty sure you can measure fairly accurately, you've experienced it for a long time. You suffer with it for a long time. And then after applying the adapter response, especially after a few minutes, applying a few times, maybe shoot for ones, see what it is that and note that, again, the beginning of might not see much of a change at all. Right? So be persistent with it. Okay. Give it a chance to work and see how it does. Okay. We'll start there and we'll kind of review how you do that. And then we'll work toward the things Analyze the bigger stressor right? And we'll see what we can do in terms of planning adaptive responses for that. Okay. So a good plan. Yes.\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, it was used a bit more.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. Okay. So how would you tie those two things together By not running?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I think the mix when I'm not exercising, generally I would turn to the more usage.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah, yeah. So when you reflect back now on last week, and the rain coming down, and it was cold, I'm wondering if there was a way that you could change your perception about that, such that it wouldn't stop you from running. What do you think?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah To change the perception above, maybe wear a rain jacket or something.\", \"completion\": \"Mm hmm, that would be a great idea. That would be an excellent idea.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I tried to stay away, but I didn't. I still saw some of them.\", \"completion\": \"So it was it was difficult to cut them out of your life? Last week?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes\", \"completion\": \"by them thinking that you were going to avoid them.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yes\", \"completion\": \"And so as a result of this what what happened?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I just ended up going to see them and then hanging out.And, yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So because you were worried about them thinking that you were trying to avoid them, you ended up using marijuana. Is that correct?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And I'm wondering how you could do that differently this week.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I could, I suppose I could just try hard enough to go and see you guys.\", \"completion\": \"And what would that involve trying harder not to go see them?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Hmm.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. Sometimes it is that simple is just making that commitment. yourself and just drawing the line. And do you have any friends that do not use marijuana that you could kind of associate with?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes i do, I don't feel that often, but I could, I could start to see that more. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. How about motivated on a scale of one to 10? Would you say you are to kind of reignite friendships with people that don't smoke pot?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Three.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. So you're still, you're still a little iffy about you about whether you want to associate with those friends again, but I have to ask you, Bruce, what do you what made you say three instead of one?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, because I know for all, so I feel like I need to, I think I should start doing something about it.\", \"completion\": \"I think that's great insight that you're able to see that moving towards The friends that don't smoke pot and making the effort to do that is actually going to enhance your life incredibly. And when you associated with the friends that didn't smoke pot in the past, what kind of things did you do?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Like what what kind of things activities and things?\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. Was it fun to be with them?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, we just mostly are like doing some outdoor activities, maybe just sort of get some pressure kind of thing. Usually it's not so like, you know, there's more. They tend to do more healthy activities, I would say.\", \"completion\": \"So you can recall living a healthier life then and having fun outdoors and basically having a healthier life overall, without using the pot.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah You're right there. It could be I might take my mind off of it.\", \"completion\": \"Sometimes it's good to remember having those good times with the friends that didn't smoke the pot because it makes you realize that you don't really need it. And I think that's a great, I think that's a great idea.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Was I really had a lot of second thoughts. I was worried about commitment and that kind of thing. So I didn't feel like that was the right the right idea.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so you had some second thoughts about that. You're excited about it and last week's session, but after you had a chance to reflect upon it, you kind of realized that it wasn't getting a dog was not the best Thanks for you, \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"a lot of commitment and a lot of time that I just don't have the motivation to be putting in.\", \"completion\": \"I think that's wise to recognize that right up front, I'm given the research on pets any kind of pet, and how it helps people sustained from alcohol and drug usage. I'm wondering if there is another option that you might consider. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Maybe. What do you have in mind?\", \"completion\": \"I'm thinking, do you like pets that aren't don't require such a commitment?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"That's a good idea. I didn't think about that.\", \"completion\": \"Because a dog is the dog is a large commitment.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. You know, there's all kinds of animals, snakes or fish or something.\", \"completion\": \"Hey, snakes ! fish, that would definitely be a star these animals that you like. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \" All right, I think it's important that you have an animal that you like and that you can relate to. Alright, so in the final goal was to find and join a support group for people that were trying to be abstinent from marijuana. How did you make out with that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I look into it. But like, I went to the first the first meeting, and I just felt like, like, those people were bought on the barrel and I was just not I just didn't fit in with that crowd where they are not in that place.\", \"completion\": \"So you made the effort to go and you went\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I couldn't, I just didn't want to stay.\", \"completion\": \"And so you didn't stay the whole time.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"And so you left early because you felt you didn't feel and you they were the bottom of the barrel and you're still higher functioning.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"I can definitely understand I'm wondering if there is any purpose for you joining some sort of support group to help you. what Do you think?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"See there could be some positive. I just don't I don't I just don't see it that much at this point.\", \"completion\": \"And what might be some positives that you would get out of the support group?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I would, I would probably be able to relate to people in the same kind of situation. And maybe it's just a positive to be able to have connection with people like that. I'm not sure.\", \"completion\": \"So you're you're saying that the past of being in a support group would be that you'd get a chance to relate to other people who are on that same journey, and to have connections with other people. And again, I can send you information that will show you that that just these two items alone are incredibly helpful for not only decreasing or being abstinent from pot, but from increasing the feel good hormones in your body, the connection and the relating to other people. It might be similar when you were younger, you had mentioned last week that you were a hockey player. And so you had support that was sort of like the team was sort of like a support group. I'm wondering if you could relate to people in head connections and wondering if you could see a support group as a team.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, it would probably be the same kind of situation like Essentially, people in a support group are all there for the same goal. So it's kind of like in hockey. Very important there to win. Mm hmm.\", \"completion\": \"And do you remember when you were playing hockey, how it felt to be encompassed in that team? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, it was good. \", \"completion\": \"It gave. And that's because of those good feeling hormones that come in neurotransmitters that come throughout your body when you have those connections. So how committed do you think you are? If I were to send you a list of support groups? So you could try out some others? Where there weren't the bottom of the barrel? As you say, there? how committed Do you think that you would be trying out at least two of them this coming week?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Probably eight, or 10. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Wow. What made you say an eight rather than a four, five was just\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"a team analogy, I think is a good analogy.\", \"completion\": \"So you thought How you remembered. You remember how you felt when you were on the team and how it gave you that sense of connection?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. And also, you know, I don't have to be the mean, if, if I think of it as a team, maybe I would be like the star on the team, because I'm not quite so bottom of the barrel. Maybe\", \"completion\": \"I love that analogy. Good thinking. It's thinking, Bruce. That's excellent. Wow. Well, just to summarize, today, you came in, you had made some progress, but you had some stumbling blocks. You have decided that whether it's rain or shine, you're going to run anyway, because you're going to have you raincoat and you're going to embrace more of your positive friends rather than the friends that are not such a good influence on you and getting a pet rather than getting it Dog, you're going to look into getting a snake or what was the other thing? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh, fish. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \" Okay. And in terms of a support group, I will send you a list of support groups. And you feel that on a scale of one to 10, that you're about an eight, and actually carrying through and trying out two of these support groups, because of the hockey team analogy. Great job. So overall, how would you rate today's session? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It was good, very good.\", \"completion\": \"And if we were to put it on a scale of one to 10,\"}\n",

That's what I gotta do sometimes.\", \"completion\": \"I see you have a, you feel like you have a relational style that doesn't match what he he wants, like you're, you're yelling and he's not liking that\"}\n",

No, that's not how you do dishes. It could be something like that. We get into an argument. It's just over two simplest things.\", \"completion\": \"And then the argument.

So you know, just doing a presentation in front of like 30 something people and so it didn't really didn't really bother me letters.

If you want me to come back to that later, just let me know as I go through if it doesn't make sense, okay. So areas here on on the SCL results, or you were a bit higher than we would normally see.

So the, so you're able to evaluate the way you are now, the vast majority of the time, right? There's a limited amount of time when you're not when there's A lot of motions going through, right? And at those times, you're maybe a little less reliable,\"}\n",

I mean, I think the problem is when we're going out during the week with my co workers, you know, I'll stay longer than I want to, and then when I have to get up in the morning, it's kind of like I should have gone check out a little earlier, but now they're all out with me.

So what we'd like to do when we identify on that felt like that is what's called self talk. And it first this may seem a little odd, right? So you have this thought that comes through it can be an image to the thought image. But it's cognitive in nature. And I can't make a mistake, like, I'm going to make a mistake. I'm going to make a mistake. That's your thought. And the self talk. This is like a rehearsed statement that you literally say to yourself, which again, I get to that seems so odd The first time I do it. So really, you're talking to yourself But over time, we believe if you can keep applying the self talk strategy that you will eventually change the outcome, the reaction and change the underlying belief. Okay? It first though it's going to seem quite foreign to you. Tell me how you how you're processing this now. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"So I mean, what am I supposed to say to myself?\", \"completion\": \"It's a good question. We'll work on that. And that's what we can do now. Let's take a look at some self talk. So some adaptive responses so they can build. So I'm going to make a mistake. That's the automatic thought that's directly leading. Seems to be to feeling supported dread, and physically not getting work on time. Has there ever been times when you've had that thought? And you went to work on time still? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"What was different about those times?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I guess I told myself, I have to get to work on time because if I don't, it's going to be even worse. If I make a mistake, and I'm late that it just, you know, it compounds and I guess I would tell myself, it's gonna be okay. You just have to get through this day. \", \"completion\": \"Alright, so when you do that, in essence, you are applying self talk. Okay. All right. So that's, that's really the same thing except you probably didn't have a label for it. And when you apply that it seems to work. So the message you're kind of sending yourself now you're telling yourself is I'm going to make a mistake still. But if I'm late for work, I'll be worse. So there's a little bit of positive and negative in here. Right self talk doesn't have to be all positive self talk needs to be, I think when anything realistic and sometimes realistic includes a little negativity. I'd rather focus on the more positive elements as we build this as possible though, so that's pretty good self talk you have now let's work on refining it a little bit to maximize its benefit.\"}\n",

So everybody makes mistakes, I could make a mistake probably not going to happen. And will could be a next part, which is realistic, but also positive.

It can be like a paragraph, or more if you want as a matter of following the protocol. Once you have the automatic thought, it's easy to descend into worry and fear. You're just looking too quick to grab a moment in there. Apply this treatment strategy. Does that make sense? Sometimes it's likely Well, most of the time, I think you would you would be able to do this. Sometimes you probably won't as important in those moments to not get discouraged. Right.

All right and and get some more details about kind of what's going on this week and your feelings surrounding that. And we touched on this a little bit in the last session. But I'd like to talk about kind of your core beliefs, your central beliefs that might be contributing some of these feelings of depression. Yeah. And then, for the last part, we'll work on like we did before, interventions to try to help you with with what's going on at work and with your depressed mood.

It's just such a long amount of time. And I just feel like, I don't know if I can really do it.

But I guess they want to get you used to doing something for eight hours a day and maybe you have something to put on your resume.

Every surface every why we got to work benches and\", \"completion\": \"Kinda Okay, well as we've talked about in the past, it's really difficult to get started on some things that we've avoided for quite some time. So, like in the past, let's brainstorm. Try to figure out how we can get some some movement in the woodworking shops. That sound good. Sure. Okay, so so one thing we've discussed in the past, Charles is extremely important is what you're thinking about as you're going into the woodworking shop. So, what are your thoughts? When you are viewing or looking at the woodworking shop? What do you think?\"}\n",

It's hopeless, it seems to me that okay, just get it back in shape again.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so let's explore that. So. So what's the evidence that it's hopeless to do some work in the woodworking shop?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"hopeless, okay, I think just\", \"completion\": \"Okay. So it prevents you from actually getting things done is what you're saying? Yes. Okay. Which makes sense because if I thought about it that way to Charles, it would be hard for me to initiate any kind of action because if I view it as overwhelming, then I'm probably They're not gonna do anything, which makes sense. So, so what do you think is an alternative way to view the woodworking shop? That would actually be helpful? What's another way?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, if I could get one workbench cleaned off, okay, I would have some space to work on.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, that's a really good start.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I could make some things that I've been thinking about making for some time. Okay, I kind of have the plans in my head. Okay. I've thought about a medieval, kind of small medieval catapult for my grandson. And maybe Boomerang made out of really nice laminated wood, that would be cool. And so I could get one or both of those built, perhaps.\", \"completion\": \"Okay? And what would that lead to? If you get those things built? What would you have to do anything with those things?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, if I if I built those, I would have to get in the car and drive for hours today. Okay, my grandkids where my grandkids are and to give them the, the toys, okay, and show them how it works and have shown how to throw the boomerang.\", \"completion\": \"So it sounds like there's a lot of benefit then to clearing out a bench and moving tools which would lead to you getting things done, especially things that would involve your grandkids so you'd be able to see them and spend time with with them, you'd feel better about going to do that. But you'd also feel better about the woodworking shop in general that basically what you're saying would Yeah, okay, sure. But as we've talked about in the past, Charles, I know that it still takes steps to get there. Right? That wouldn't change overnight. So I think one useful strategies for you and I to work on a step by step plan that would get us to the place of you being able to drive for hours to see your grandkids. So how about we talked about the first step, which sounds like would be to just move things off one bench? Does that sound right?\"}\n",

But I think in general that, you know, I'm a pretty good student before this. And I'm doing pretty well in the program.\", \"completion\": \"So you're a good student, you recognize that you have this one area where you don't feel like you do a great job. That's presentations.

      "{\"prompt\": \"like maybe I shouldn't be in this program. I think they should just drop out.\", \"completion\": \"So if they believe you're an imposter based on these physical symptoms, like anxiety and mood that means to you anyway, that that means you shouldn't be on there.\"}\n",

So I'd like to move a little bit into evaluating evidence. So in this kind of therapy, we like to look at what, you know, what we're feeling and what we're thinking, and what's we can see what's observable around us. And, you know, that becomes evidence and then we analyze it, evaluate it, okay. You're worried at some level. You're worried that you don't deserve to be where you are right now. Yeah. That you're not good enough. To be a student in this program, yeah, programming. What evidence supports that belief that you're not good enough?\"}\n",

So your amygdala Like right here at the base of your brain back here And it's known as the alarm center, saying think about pulling alarm, you know, an alarm is going off in your brain. And that alarm, normally it indicates fight or flight or freeze So makes you want to fight, fight back, right, It makes you want to freeze, just kind of pain free don't let you do or flight which means get out of there, you know, get away. All right. So that's kind of what your brain that's the largest mess kind of your brain.

And then you can practice it all week, and then we talk next week, we'll kind of see how you are with that and it's not working for you, we'll make modifications might change this, okay? Okay. And this is a technique where you can do it at school, at home, and only takes about one minute. Sometimes we don't have a lot of time. You know, it's great when you can take 15 minutes to calm down, maybe you're going to bed at night and you're doing something that makes you calm down and it's quiet a lot of time.

Alright, Breathing in and lot of oxygen right there. All right, the O means observe what is going on around you right now. All right. so in this situation, your mom asked you to do the dishes. You're watching the program. All right. Like to finish the program, I think I heard you say, and then you're going to do the dishes. That's how you would like it might not be how mom like it.

I'm getting frustrated that she's asked me to do this right now, observe it, name it, claim it and say, okay, that's how I'm feeling right now. All right.

      "{\"prompt\": \"my clinical psychologist has told me that I needed to see someone. I thought I didn't need to see someone because there was nothing wrong with me. I just had a heart disease. And I, my heart disease had got so severe and I was just tired and there was no one that could make it better. By listening to me or talking to me, the only thing I thought that could heal me was heart surgery. And when he suggested that I see someone, it didn't seem to make sense. But because I was so depressed, so far gone, I, my husband through my husband, I thought I try and just take a chance and just listen to someone or let someone Listen to me, because I wasn't sure what it entailed. I've never been to a clinical psychologist before. So to me as a clinical psychologist was a shrink, you must have had something seriously wrong with your brain that you needed to see a clinical psychologist, and I didn't need to see one. But when I did Mita and I realized that not being able to make up my mind by Waiting for surgery for heart surgery. I'm putting my name down on the list. I needed someone to help be accepted in order to get surgery done, because I didn't want to get surgery done and she listened to me and to the way I felt and what was making me whoa, hold back on surgery and what made me feel the way I did. And funnily enough, as a woman, you tend to feel that you can cry on someone else's shoulder. But for the first time, just letting my emotions out to her. She helped me cry and by me speaking to her, it helped me see myself from the inside. If that makes sense. I then I began to understand why I had to get heart surgery done wasn't because I was tired but I had my family and everyone that went through the road with me of suffering was mad so I needed to get it done. And then eventually I did put my name down on the list not knowing it would be done so quick because asked was just supposed to take me six to eight months to get heart surgery done. But when I started seeing my clinical psychology, I understood it, I put my name down and I got my surgery done in 30 days time. So it sounds like part of the clinical psychologists role with you is to help you to make your decision around whether to get surgery or not. Yes. But you also said that you were quite depressed at the time was the CBT helpful for your depression as well, it helped because then, instead of crying and holding things back emotionally, it helped me let things out. And by letting things out, it helped me understand what I was feeling because most of the time we bottle things up, we never let them out or we never talk to each other, or other people. So when we bottle stuff up, it makes it harder for us to figure out ways to solve problems. Sometimes it can be a little problem and we turn it into a big problem because we just don't communicate with other people or talk things over to make it easier to understand. And she helped me understand and I saw her before surgery right through my heart surgery and after heart surgery, and she helped me. By then by the time I started with heart surgery, I'd lost myself confidence. I was so depressed, I was so withdrawn. But after I had heart surgery, and I carried on seeing her, she helped me gain my confidence back again. She helped me gain my trust again, she helped me see that there was something worth loving for again. And a lot of times when I think of the things that are needed for me, it brings tears to my eyes and makes my heart swell up because I didn't know another person could do that for you. By just listening to you, you know, like when we go to mom when you got a problem and you think no one can understand, but my mom can because she knows what I'm coming from. But it's not to say that clinical psychologists are like that. But it's just the way they listen to you.

And that's how I in by the time I'd finished therapy with her, I found out that clinical psychologists are not just strings. They are people like us and they do feel like us and it's so much easier. To speak to someone when you're having problems because we all do in our lifetime breakdown sooner or later. If you don't have to be mentally ill, you can be in a car accident, any any problems in the home is something you can even have a death in the family that you can break down with.

Is he really taking care of the kid as good as you know, what if he's just cleaning up the house and doing the right things on there while I'm not there?

And there are several different cognitive distortions, there's several patterns that we kind of see. come up often in this work, right as a counselor, wondering, in the situation where you're thinking, the worst possible outcome is unbearable, or likely or both. If you may be really focusing and emphasizing on that, to the exclusion of other evidence that suggests you've made a good decision.

      "{\"prompt\": \"So and I feel I wish I did better. I wish I got A's but I mean, these are fine. But when I take this because it's not it doesn't. I don't know how it translates.\", \"completion\": \"About your study habits if you consider yourself effective and studying ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I've tried I've taken workshops on studying I've, I, I think I'm pretty effective at studying I've found what doesn't work. So, I try to study by reading the chapter is taking outlines reviewing flashcards, which has, I think the best results but\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so your study habits are good. And your quiz scores are good. But you're still having these distressing thoughts and these uncomfortable physical sensations when you take the quizzes? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Is that about right?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, that's absolutely right.\", \"completion\": \"So really, you don't necessarily need your performance to change. You just you just need to your thoughts and feelings and behaviors to change. Yeah. So how you how you're reacting to the quizzes maybe.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, cuz I get B's like I said so Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And B is good.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So Alright, so I want to take you back to the moment when you're looking at the first slide. Let's go back to that for a second. Okay. So you're taking a quiz. And you're having those thoughts surrounding the first item, which will not mistaken the automatic thought we talked about this right with cognitive behavioral therapy. Go on Mac thought is that I'm, I'm not going to get this one right.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"or something to that effect ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right.\", \"completion\": \"What does that mean to you?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It means once I don't get that, right, I'm not Getting in anything else, right, okay\", \"completion\": \"Alright So with that thought means to you is that you're going to miss that item and then you're going to miss all the rest of it. So you're, you're going to fail the whole quick whole thing. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So looking at that, almost, let's call that an intermediate belief, right? It's more of a rule or an expectation, right? What does that mean to you?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It just gets worse. If I fail the quiz, then I'm like, Oh my god, I'm gonna fail the panel, I am going to fail the course and that's gonna affect my GPA.\", \"completion\": \"So just keep stacking other other beliefs. So you're gonna fail the course. And we're gonna fail the final rather than then the course. So a few failed the course. What does that mean to you ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"not going to graduate.\", \"completion\": \"You're not going to graduate ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So we've moved from failing the quiz if we just look at the meaning, right? To fail on the final to fail on the course, and now to not graduating. So if you didn't graduate, what would that mean to you?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't know who I'd be at that point. That's what I always saw as my career. So I don't know what my future would look like at that point. Without that.\", \"completion\": \"So if you were to phrase it, and kind of think back as we to the CBT techniques and the kind of conceptualization uncovered. If you're to phrase as an if statement. What would you? What would you be if you couldn't be a teacher? what that make you?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I am a person who didn't make it. I'm a person that failed. Like we said earlier.\", \"completion\": \"I'm a person who didn't make it. I'm a person who failed. So in a way, you're saying, I'm a failure. \"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Is that close?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, Its fine. \", \"completion\": \"So remember, we talked before about core beliefs, and how these core beliefs drive these intermediate beliefs which combined with situations like in your case, taking quizzes to form these automatic thoughts. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"so one of your core beliefs may be that, that you're a failure. You may believe that.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"Does that seem like something that you've said to yourself before or thought before?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"And think about it like that until we did the step up to it now, but I, I can relate to that.\", \"completion\": \"Mmm hmm\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Because a lot of times, I do feel like, Oh, I'm not gonna be able to do this. Because it's me, I won't be able to do it.\", \"completion\": \"Not because it's challenging or difficult, but something to do with you. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Hmm yeeah.\", \"completion\": \"Right. So that's what I call like the you're personalizing ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"So you're saying to yourself, at a variety of levels. I'm going to be unsuccessful? I'm going to....doe that make sense. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Do you think that's what's happening?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It must be because like I said, I study I got good grades. I've been tested years ago, I don't have ADHD anything intrinsic that would prohibit me\", \"completion\": \"So you're  able to focus and calm.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah,\", \"completion\": \"well, \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yes, I can do all of that. But when it comes to it, I'm like, I can't do it.\", \"completion\": \"So, somewhere, somewhere is this dis core belief? And it's possible that it has something to do with you believing that you are a failure. unsuccessful? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't think they would see the connection. I think it would be like, well, you do well in school, I don't understand.\", \"completion\": \"So they wouldn't believe that you're a failure ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No\", \"completion\": \"you may believe it ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. I guess, Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And similarly, if you had a classmate that was in the same situation, and and you know, struggled with these disturbing thoughts and feelings and behaviors during quizzes, how would you evaluate them?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I guess I'd say the same thing that my family would say like you're gonna look at the evidence, you're not a failure.\", \"completion\": \"And you evaluate that they weren't a failure.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"But If it was  yourself. You're being a little more harsh.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Which isn't uncommon.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \" So, there's a few levels at which I think we can go after this. What I'll call a problem, but really, it's a series of thoughts and beliefs. Okay. The first is that the comic at the ground level, and that's when you are taking the quiz. And you have that automatic thought that says, I'm going to miss this item. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I'm not going to get it right.\", \"completion\": \"Yes, I'm not gonna get it right. So that's your thought, I'm not going to get it right.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Ahmm hmm\", \"completion\": \"And these situations, I like to encourage clients to apply what's called an adaptive response or self talk. So it's a it's a noun. If you're in a quiz in a quiet classroom, it wouldn't literally be self taught. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right, right.\", \"completion\": \"But it's a thought that you were consciously applying. So the other thought that's automatic,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"that just pops in your head, right. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"This one would be one that you deliberately think\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"and make myself.\", \"completion\": \"So what could you think to yourself that would be a counter to that automatic thought that you're having, that you're gonna get that item wrong ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I guess that in my past quizzes like, chances are I, I have a good chance of getting it right.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so just looking at the probabilities based on your past performance, even though I'm thinking I'm going to get it wrong\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right.\", \"completion\": \"Chances are, I'm going to get it wrong,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right. Somehow I still have a B so.\", \"completion\": \"So you are getting most of them. Right.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right. So I have a good chance.\", \"completion\": \"So I like that adaptive response. Right. Do you think that makes sense for you?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"I think you did well, there. So the next time you're taking a quiz I want you to apply that adaptiv response.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"that this takes work. Right. So this automatic thoughts gonna come upon you. And then before you know it, you're gonna have that feeling. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, right. \", \"completion\": \"physical symptoms.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Discuss the sweaty palms. Right. And the feeling of I think you mentioned\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So don't let it discourage you those symptoms Come on so quickly.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Right. There is an intervening thought and you've identified it. Right. So, you will have an opportunity, most likely to apply that automatic thought at some point. But the first few times it might be a little rough. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, testing QA. \", \"completion\": \"I guess the nice thing about a quiz is, I mean, how many items are on these quizzes?  \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"15\", \"completion\": \"So you have a few different chances to apply the adaptive responses. Right,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right. It's more than one.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. So you know, you'd like to get on the first time where you have that on I thought we identified on that thought, but if you don't No big deal. Right? So, you know, later on maybe it takes them two or three. And then you might remember, hey, I have this\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Oh, wait, supposed to be thinking that.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. And my hope is that as you apply this adaptive response more and more, you can reduce the probability that that automatic thoughts going to come in. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"So that's one level that I want you to, to go after it. Does that make sense?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It does. I think I can do that.\", \"completion\": \"That's how many feel like you could you could do at the other level, I guess you'd call this a deeper level, but it's all really, you know, in your brain, right? It's just this core belief.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. And why use the word deeper is because we think of core beliefs as more stubborn, but they don't change as easily.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right\", \"completion\": \"as automatic thoughts might. I'd like you to and this is really just more selection, reflect on the evidence or evaluate the evidence that supports and refutes this idea that you were unsuccessful that you're a failure. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"Right. I think cognitively, you kind of understand that you're not. Right. But another sense, you feel like you are right. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"So in a way cognitively you're\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"there's that discrepancy.\", \"completion\": \"Right. Right. There's, there's a little bit of both. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Mm hmm. Yeah, \", \"completion\": \"you can tell me that, your family would say that's not the case. But you still\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right on paper, Technically, I would. I'm not. But I still, I guess, feel that way.\", \"completion\": \"There's a part of you that still feels that way. There's a part of you that still believes that cognitively. There's also a part of you that thinks through that says that's that's not accurate.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"So I want you to weigh the validity of that core belief.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"Right. And actually, I think that this is helpful to write down evidence that that would support it. Right. And that's certainly something to note. But also, and this is really more important evidence that refutes it. evidence that runs counter, \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right, \", \"completion\": \"but record both, and we'll meet next time and we'll look at the evidence evaluated.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, we can do that.\", \"completion\": \"So those two, those two steps you feel like you're comfortable with and they make sense to you.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, they do. Yeah, I definitely think I can do those. \", \"completion\": \"When's the next time you'll be taking a quiz?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Think next week\", \"completion\": \"next week?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah\", \"completion\": \"Okay, I know how these quizzes oftehn? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"All right. So we'll set up a session for next week. Let's try to get towards after your next quiz.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"So we'll have that to talk about. I think that's the next area to make. It sounds like the next area. It'd be good to try and make progress.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Seems like that's what you want to work on.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So We'll go from there. So I'll set up an appointment for just to have that quiz. Tried to adapt the response and try evaluating evidence. Quickly.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes, \", \"completion\": \"does that sound good ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes, I can do that. \", \"completion\": \"All right. I will set the appointment up and I appreciate you coming in and working through this.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I'm fine. Thanks. Well, strange feeling strange for this, but okay.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah, it's something really different for you.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Umm hmm I have I've not done this before.\", \"completion\": \"Well, why don't you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I'm not even sure I am I heard about this place and that you work with women who are having trouble with a relationship and are confused. And so I thought I'd give you guys a call. And so I'm, thank you so much for taking the time to see me.\", \"completion\": \"So you're, you've heard a little bit about the program here. Would it help if I just explained a little bit about what what my role might be today?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, yeah, cuz I don't know what to do.\", \"completion\": \"What I want to reassure you of is that I'm not here to try and tell you anything that you might need to do or to try and give you advice or information at all. I'm here to help you in whatever way is useful to you to sort out what what's going on and what if anything you'd like to do differently. So this is really up to you. What you would like to explore today, how does that sound?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"That sounds really hard because I'm not sure I'm very good at sorting things out myself. Yeah. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So right now you're feeling a little overwhelmed with everything that's going on, and you're not even sure where to start.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, that's a good way to put it. I'm kind of confused about what to do next. And I have a little baby at home, so I don't I can't think anyway, most the time.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. So now anything any kind of decisions you make, or anything that you do affects both you and and the baby. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Mm hmm. And, and my boyfriend affects him. Which is why I guess I guess I'm here to talk about him and me and the baby and what we're, you know, how we work together.\", \"completion\": \"Well, I if you're interested or you're willing, why don't you tell me a little bit about your story?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't know where to start. He and I had been together for about a year. And I got pregnant right away and we just had this baby a little while ago. And and before that I was working. And he and I, you know, we're on and off here and there, we get invites and he disappears for a while then he comes back. That's kind of what the ears look like. And I just been getting more and more confused on what to do and recently he did something really that didn't even look like him. He looked like a different person and it freaked me out and freaked the baby out. And quite honestly, it freaked him out too. He didn't he said he didn't know what happened and he felt he said he felt out of control.\", \"completion\": \"So the in the history of the relationship over this year, it's kind of been in and out in a way and there have been Some incidents where you've had some arguments and then separated for a while and gotten back together but it does sound like something pretty significant happened that sort of freaked everybody out. All all of you the baby and you and him and, and was kind of scary. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Mm hmm. Yeah, he came home. I was a friend come over a man friend, he doesn't like me to have men friends came over to help me with my resume, because I'm starting to think about going back to work. And he had a weird look in his eye and so I kind of, you know, we sped up and I kind of let my friend leave but soon as after right after he left he he kind of just got this dark, scary look and he pushed me onto the ground and and it was just different than anything that ever happened to me or us together and He just got this weird kind of like he was possessed by something. And he said he didn't, he would never do that again. He's he's really good daddy. And he really helps us out a lot.\", \"completion\": \"So in a way it doesn't, it didn't even really make sense to you or to him, because on the one hand, He's really good.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Yeah. And he's, he's, he really helps us out. And I didn't know what to do with that.

He's he's sort of made it clear that I don't need to work because he's going to take care of us he brings home diapers and gives us some money when he's around and so we really don't need it most the time.\", \"completion\": \"So you had been kind of thinking about maybe going back to work and doing doing some of that on your on your own and, and yet He, he doesn't really he's expressing that he liked to be able to take care of you.

We can certainly talk about resources about the resources in the community that may be there for you, or in terms of your own understanding.

I mean, one of the one of the important things is to try and help you find a way to make sure that you feel good about keeping yourself and in your baby safe. And we can talk about that.

I want you to keep in mind how you felt after the times before. Now you do tend to pull out of this. And you look back at a lot differently. But in the moment, it's hard to see that. That doesn't necessarily make this any easier. But if you can hang on to we can get through this cycle of depression. You'll probably have a different outlook. If history is any evidence.

Yeah, they ask you variety questions like there are 40 questions. Like your social security number, date of birth, other information they need to carry out billing and different administrative functions. But the purpose of this intake today is much different. I'm gonna be asking much more personal questions. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"Specifically related to things that happening in your life and your symptoms. You're comfortable with them?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Sure.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. Before I get started with the first section, I want to talk a little bit about confidentiality. When you see a counselor for treatment, the communication that you have with that counselor is confidential, but there's this big asterisk next to the word confidential. Okay. And I want to explain to the certain circumstances under which confidentiality might be broken. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"So, so let's start at, everything's confidential. And then I'll explain the exceptions to you, like make sense. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Sure.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. The probably the largest exception. One of the most frequently used exceptions is if you sign a release, for me to break confidentiality, this is not uncommon. For example, if you want me to talk to your physician because a physical condition or medication you're taking could be affecting your mood. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"you might sign a release that allows me to communicate with your physician. Oftentimes, the physician will require the same thing. So that should be two releases, okay, one that he or she keeps, and one that I keep. Okay. Similarly, if you have a family member, that you want to bring in for a session, because somehow it might be related to what's going on with you, you would have to sign a release. If you did That I then could communicate with that family member. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh, okay. \", \"completion\": \"Does that make sense?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"Even though releases have to be in writing to be in effect, except in extreme circumstances, you can discontinue release at anytime I call an agency and tell them that you want your release canceled. So say that, you know, I have no reasonably this is the case. Let's say you have a family member that comes in and there's a session and it goes, Okay. But then your relationship with that family member breaks down at a point. And now you think well, I don't want them calling in and being able to talk to your counselor. All you have to do is call in and the administrative staff will cancel that. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"If you do that, that's fine. But also next time you see me Tell me and I'll double check and make sure that it's been cancelled in your chart.  Does that make sense? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Umm yeah\", \"completion\": \"Okay. Another exception to confidentiality is what's called cognitive care, meaning you're here at agency and you're seeing me, but a lot of other people work here and have some investment or duties related to your care. For example, somebody has to follow the charts. Somebody has to do the billing. There's a director to this agency, right, that has an interest in your care as well. So I'm permitted to speak to those individuals about things that we talk about. I only do so to the extent that I need to, for example, from talking to a person in billing, I'm not going to tell them about deep dark secrets you may have in your life, history or something, right. I'm going to talk about what they need to know which is usually what type of insurance does she have? Or is there a change in insurance is coming or something like that kind of questions are asking me aren't typically a personal nature. And if they were, I wouldn't answer them. However, with the director of the agency, that would be a different level of disclosure. Does that make sense? Because they're a clinical and they're a clinical person.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"So you can tell them my deep dark secrets,\", \"completion\": \"I could, I generally would try to avoid that \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"good.\", \"completion\": \"But if you know there's a a treatment team meeting, and your particular case was being discussed, then, you know, other clinicians and the director would have access to information now they're bound by the same rules of confidentiality, but I'm bound by okay. We do this because it promotes good care. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"That makes sense\", \"completion\": \"So we have information that you voluntarily release, right cognitive care another exception is if I have reason to believe that you're going to harm somebody. It's called a tarifs of duty. Right? It's a duty to warn. So again, I imagine this is why. I know this is unlikely in general. And your specific case, I imagine it's unlikely. But if you were to tell me that you were going to harm somebody, and then you left this office, I would have to contact them and warn them that you're on your way to harm. Again, this wouldn't involve disclosing a family secrets and all kinds of diagnoses. This would just be Hey, Kelly coming out to harm you. Okay, and I'm warning you, and you should probably do something about that, like call the police or flee. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay. That's not gonna happen.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah, I think again, I want to cover these things. They're oftentimes not used, but that's one of those rare things that has happened in the past, I don't imagine having by one time about it anyway.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay. Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Another exception to confidentiality is if I believe that, in general, you're a danger to yourself or others, meaning without a specific target in mind, you're, I feel that I have evidence to support that you're going to be a danger to someone else or the public in general, or a danger to yourself. I have to and I have the ability to, an authority to take steps to prevent you from harming yourself or somebody else. I'll only disclose what information I need to to prevent you from harming yourself or somebody else. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay, that makes sense. \", \"completion\": \"And the same would apply in the case if you had been threatened harm somebody else.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"So I want to emphasize at this point, that if you tell me that you have suicidal thoughts or homicidal thoughts, that doesn't necessarily mean law enforcement or inpatient facilities are going to be involved. Okay, we can talk about it. And a lot of people, especially if they have any type of depression, have suicidal thoughts. It's extremely common, and homicidal thoughts are actually fairly common as well. Rarely are they acted upon, but they're common thoughts. So I want you to feel free to discuss those without fear that I'm just going to reach up the phone and call the police because that's not gonna be the case. But if there's a clear threat, and I'm really worried then I will act and all this is actually to protect you and the public.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"The the another exception to confidentiality is if you provide information to me that leads me to believe a child or an elderly person is being abused. Now, interestingly, with this exception, it doesn't matter if you're the abuser or not. You could tell me about your neighbor, and how on your way to therapy, you saw that person abused their child tben I will actually report that.  And again, I'm just giving the information they need to try to prevent any harm to the child or does it make sense? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah\", \"completion\": \"Okay, and the last thing exception and confidentiality would be and this is very rare, but it can happen. So I want to tell you about it. If for some reason, during the course of this therapy or even after this therapy has terminated, you get involved with the civil legal system in the criminal legal system, and a judge orders me to disclose information from your chart or from our experiences, okay. Technically, a judge can do that, and I'll have to follow his or her orders. Before I would make a such disclosure, I would certainly make my case to the judge, that I don't want to make that disclosure and try to restrict that disclosure as much as possible. But in the end, it's important to know that I don't have the power to make the final decision, it would be in the hands of a judge. Again, this happens very rarely, but I do on but you know, there's an exception to confidentiality. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay. Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Do you understand all those as I'm describing to you?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And you have any questions about any of those?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No. So, like, if I told you that I was feeling really sad, and I thought about killing myself, you're not gonna?\", \"completion\": \"we're gonna have a discussion about that. Yeah, I'm not gonna, okay. I don't have the authority actually to lock anybody. Yeah, all I could do is to, well, the first thing I would do is assess the seriousness, and we'll try to work out some sort of safety plan that we can both be happy with. Okay, and that keeps you safe. But in terms of the extreme, whereas you said, Look, I really, you know, I'm going to harm myself and I'm going to do it soon. And here's I'm going to do it. My recourse would be to call law enforcement and they have a variety of options that are available to them. Of course, one is taking into an inpatient facility or something like that. Sometimes they arrive in Scituate is changed by then all kinds of possibilities. That's really a move of last resort. That's not going to be my first call. My first or my first action, my first action is going to be communicating with you and seeing where we are. And it's not unusual that clients have suicidal ideation to some degree for many sessions in a row. Right? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay, so that's not unusual\", \"completion\": \"no, particularly with any type of depressive disorder, or even just feelings of depression that don't rise to that diagnostic level. It's not uncommon to have passive suicidal ideation, like maybe wishing that you wouldn't wake up the next day or something. That's a lot different than you telling me that you have a plan to harm yourself and that you're going to do it. Does that make sense? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Any Other questions about those limits of confidentiality.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No, its pretty clear\", \"completion\": \"If you're ever at a point where you're unsure, you don't remember what they are, of course, they're included in the information received screening, and there's a sheet that had them on there. But feel free to ask me about them. Right. And I'll be happy to clarify any points, anything that you might have forgot from now until that point, and I'll be happy to explain it again. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"All right. So let's move to the next step. Let's go with you\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"check.\", \"completion\": \"I'm going to be asking you questions from a wide variety of domains. subject matters, like relational history, emotional history. So certain areas, you may want to talk about more than others and I'll make a note of that. But I don't want to get too in depth in terms of any therapy at this point, because this is me trying to collect data. This is like a data collection stage. So this sets the framework and structure for what we're doing later on part of it. But I understand that some of the topics I bring up you may want to expand upon. So if that happens, I'm probably just going to point you back toward what we're doing. But I'll make a note here to make sure we cover later. Kind of makes sense?\"}\n",

Many of these likely will not apply to you. I like to cover everything in the section, regardless. Okay. So as I touch on a topic, like the first one is memory loss. Okay. As I touch on a topic, let me know if it's happening currently.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Because, you know, the problem is if they're drinking, they're gonna pressure you into drinking and then you're gonna feel awkward and you know, you're gonna be stuck and not know what to do and really just be better off probably without them. If they if, if they're the kind of people who are going to keep drinking, they're probably not a good influence. \"}\n",

Last time we talked to you, you were very clear about the fact that you can't control Paul, when he's in his fear and his rage and being violent.

It's a medication will often give if someone is in heart failure, but if someone is really sick, and then we don't think we have time to give it that's the time we would think of a breathing tube. haven't had a chance to look through the chart, but it would suggest to me you were pretty close to dying when you came in.\"}\n",

I agree with you that it is your wish, and we will respect that wish that we're not going to put a breathing tube down again. And then of course, your second question, which is great, as well as how do we make sure this doesn't happen? So what I'm going to do after our conversation, and I do have a few more questions, To ask you but after conversation, I write a note documenting what we talked about that we talked about the breathing too. And your reasons for why you don't want it, which of course makes sense to me. And then what I do is I document a short form called goals of care. And I just so it's a really easy way for everyone to look at the form and in two seconds, I know exactly what you want, we will give you a copy of that to take home. But I find that's not usually enough. What we also do, what I do is I tend to when you leave hospital, dictate a note to your family doctor. And that notes actually available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in Alberta. And in that note will very clearly state you and I have this conversation and you really didn't want the breathing to so I reassure you, we'll do everything we can to make sure people understand you don't want that to Okay.\"}\n",

How are you feeling?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Certainly, Oh, yes. Oh, look at medication, just not the intubation.\", \"completion\": \"Okay. And then usually along the lines with the intubation when people don't want the intubation, we often also want to know, if a nurse were to walk into the room and find just by bad luck, you would pass away or if someone just found you at home, who had passed away. Would you ever want people pushing on your chest and giving you shocks trying to bring you back to life?\"}\n",

Maybe hard to answer this question, because you don't know what that is. But to have any thoughts on that, if you were really sick if we were to try just a mask, and we would do it just as long as you were okay with it and comfortable at the time,\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"TRUE\", \"completion\": \"But I want to emphasize most of the time getting in touch with family and getting supports around you House a lot.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Ok\", \"completion\": \"We'll figure it out as we, as we move through and work toward a diagnosis. But as you commit to therapy, and as you come in for counseling regularly, I hope that these symptoms would improve. And oftentimes they do, obviously, I can't guarantee it, but oftentimes they do. So I want to, I want you to recognize that it's a value to be hopeful, and to look forward to good things. And to realize you take a big step by coming here today. And it was difficult and it wasn't easy by answering all these questions rehashing all these things. And the work of counseling itself is challenging times. But I do think it's worth it.

I know it's, it's not the same, it's a lot harder for me to produce what I used to.\", \"completion\": \"And you're afraid that's going to be noticed as well?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, for sure. But I can't take detox, there's it's just not an option.\", \"completion\": \"Alright. Let's talk about I want to do some scaling work. I want to talk about the importance of this change to you know, cuz we've been talking about this change for a while\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"that change, like giving up the Percocet. \", \"completion\": \"Yeah. Let's talk about, let's just talk about the importance of it though. So just focus on that one narrow piece. Okay, we're just we're just talking about how important it is. So on a scale of one to 10, with one being not important at all, and 10 being extremely important. How important is it to you that you that you can make this change? Can you make this change?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"See, I go back and forth. I don't know that it's that important. Well, if I lose my job, that would be horrible. So maybe it is pretty important.

They've been tied together a little bit, right.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, because to get out of bed, yeah. Okay.\", \"completion\": \"So if you if you if you had to pick a number one to 10, or 10 is extremely important. How important is it to you to make the change?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Alright, eight. I mean, I got to keep it up.\", \"completion\": \"You have to keep it up?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So let's talk about another construct. That's important.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"I want to talk about confidence. So using that same scale, how confident are you that you can beat the Percocet?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"That's what I've been trying to do for how long have I been coming in here?\", \"completion\": \"About about six months now.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I've tried I mean, I have really tried. I know I can't I don't I don't. I don't think I can do it.\", \"completion\": \"So it was in the one to 10 scale. What do you think you would be?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Like 0   1 I can't. I've been trying.\", \"completion\": \"So very low confidence, nope really no confidence. You have no confidence. You have no confidence that you can change and it's very important to you that you do change. So this is a real bind the trend. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, it's pretty depressing.\", \"completion\": \"You mentioned that one of the reasons your confidence is low is because you tried over the last six months and working with me and you've not been successful at stopping the Percocet use.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I'll leave here swearing to myself. I'm done. You know that next week I'm going to come in and I'm going to tell you that I didn't use at all and then like before, I'm in bed. I've already taken some you know that night.\", \"completion\": \"So it's easy to see where the low confidence rating comes in. Based on your experiences the last six months. How about other times when you've been able to make a tough change? If you look through your, your past and different experiences, has there been any other occasions where you have been successful, beating something like this and making a tough change?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, yeah, I mean, I used to I used to with the gambling I guess, I I used to hit Delaware Park, you know, on a regular basis and spent a lot of money and my husband was pretty upset about it and I had a really hard time stopping that. \", \"completion\": \"So that was those tough that was. Would you say that you felt addicted to gambling?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"We Oh yeah, definitely.\", \"completion\": \"And it was painful to stop. Are you happy that you did stop?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh, God, I would never want to go back to that. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So when you were in the middle of that addiction of gambling, right, how likely to seem that you would be able to stop back then?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, that's that's a really good point. I didn't think that I was going to be able to say probably about a to two or three. \", \"completion\": \"So there's some parallels here between what happened with the gambling and with what's happening now the Percocet.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I didn't think about it that way. So I really didn't think I could do it then and it's been, you know, a couple years since I've even been in a casino.\", \"completion\": \"So you would say you were successful at beating that addiction?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, definitely.\", \"completion\": \"Definitely success, so what happened? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It's so different. It's different. It's so different. Oh my god. Let's talk about that. Just like I just find myself popping them in my mouth. You know.\", \"completion\": \"So the mechanism is different. Like for the gambling, you'd have to drive to the casino to drive Delaware Park. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"You'd have to have money\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right, Right. \", \"completion\": \"Whereas the the percocets so easy. Yeah that you get them for my friends.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And it's a lot easier to consume and Percocet than to get in your car and make the time and so the mechanism is different.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"But wonder if there's any similarities with this? Well, with the success and the potential success, meaning you you thought that you could never stop gambling, you think that you could never get through detox?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I didn't think about detox, but you're right. It was miserable in that period when I first stopped kind of casino and I felt that really strong urge to go. And I made it through that, my husband was amazing.\", \"completion\": \"You husband was supportive?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh yeah, he was really great. He would sit with me he would talk me through it. We go to movies sweet, you now he was really encouraging. Probably be really happy to see me stop using these Percocet too.\", \"completion\": \"So as you reflect on your confidence, and this is not something you necessarily need to do right now. It's probably important to consider that you were successful before in the past. All the circumstances were different. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"But you gained too high from that gambling.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"that was it was addictive?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"and and you beat it and it and it was hard it was challenging but you also have a supportive husband. Would you have your support your husband if you tried to stop Percocet?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh, yeah. Yeah. He He's really, you know, upset, by the way, and I'm taking them and he's really worried about me losing the job. I don't see why he wouldn't be able to help me in the same way, I guess.\", \"completion\": \"Well, since this since stopping is important to you, but your confidence is low. But this might be a good area to kind of process which is, you know, you do have the supports in place, and you have successfully defeated addiction before. So it's something to consider, as you weigh, you know, I know that detox is something you've expressed really clearly that you're not a big fan of and I can appreciate your reasons. At the same time, get support, you don't lose your job. So, let's do this. Let's, between now and when I see you next, maybe reflect on some of the strengths and supports and the past successes you've had. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"And see if we can accurately factor those into this equation. Right as you're processing through and and considering a very tough decision. So it makes sense?\"}\n",

So can you contract for safety?\"}\n",

I'm not predicting or hoping to take will and I don't have any reasonably they will, but I want to be prepared. I want you to be prepared just in case sometimes have these thoughts that kind of imagine that sometimes you're not thinking about them at all and other times are a little stronger. So if they get if they get stronger, if there's a market change in them, Okay, so it comes less passive and more. You start thinking about a plan or something like that. Tell me what you would do?\"}\n",

Like, not a good mom, not a good spouse. All all these thoughts are understandable in the context of being down or maybe depressed, right? If that's what's going on, it sounds like that is what could be going on. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Ok\", \"completion\": \"We'll figure it out as we, as we move through and work toward a diagnosis. But as you commit to therapy, and as you come in for counseling regularly, I hope that these symptoms would improve. And oftentimes they do, obviously, I can't guarantee it, but oftentimes they do. So I want to, I want you to recognize that it's a value to be hopeful, and to look forward to good things. And to realize you take a big step by coming here today. And it was difficult and it wasn't easy by answering all these questions rehashing all these things. And the work of counseling itself is challenging times. But I do think it's worth it. If it has a good chance it does, of improving how you feel.

And when we look at the total score, you scored quite high actually scored in a range that we would sort of call the 99th percentile, which means Yeah, which means that your anger is at Level greater than 99% of the population of men your age\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"I've always recognized that I've seen it, try to deny a lot of times, but then I recognize it that I'm going to say that I know I have issues. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. So this kind of just highlights that and puts a number on and it sounds\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"so that's where the studies have been done.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah, right. Exactly. Kind of comparing how you answered the question to, to the general population of folks of your age Because you're really you're sort of in the top 1% of scores\"}\n",

Forget I'm sure I could\", \"completion\": \"So stopping smoking is not important to you, but you're fairly confident you could if you decided to quit.

      "{\"prompt\": \"I don't know. Like, I guess it would It would help to be able to, like explain to my girlfriend that like the stuff that I get from smoking and like you You seem you kind of seem like you get it so like, I don't know, maybe figure out ways to like explain to her the things that I get from smoking to like, I don't know just kind of help her like realize why I do it other than just to kill myself.\", \"completion\": \"So to help her to understand why smoking works for you.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"That's that's one goal than any other goals you could think of I mean, you came in, in part because you're well, that seemed to appear like you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured you. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So any other relational goals you might want to work on there?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, no, we haven't really been like we've been fighting a lot because of the smoking. So I think like, maybe figuring out ways like to maybe communicate better or like having like good fights in a way like I don't ascribe that but like having fights that are productive like that just don't always end like with us just like going our separate ways or like one of us leaving the house but like, I guess being able to like wrap up a fight so it doesn't last for like days.\", \"completion\": \"So productive communication and productive arguments\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right yeah, yeah. \", \"completion\": \"So so one goal would be to illustrate clearly the advantages of smoking to your girlfriend.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"She understands how important it is to you\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Because it does seem like it's really important to you. But another would be to work on your relation, your relational style, so that you, you can end argument and feel like you're not at a stalemate?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right Yeah, yeah, I think that'd be cool. \", \"completion\": \"All right. Well, you want to make those two goals. We work one so we can spend this time going up too fast. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I can do it that it's kind of like killing two birds with one stone.\", \"completion\": \"Does that make sense to me. Well, that's what we'll do. So what I'd like to do, I'll see you again and about a week. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right, right. \", \"completion\": \"So if you could reflect on some of these changes you think you can make with this relationship where you could do in the relationship to be a more effective communicator. Because a lot of this revolves around communication.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah\", \"completion\": \"communicating the advantages of smoking, but also communicating in the arguing, so that you have productive end to these arguments, right. So it's really more moving from arguments to collegial conversations that have a positive result. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Yeah, that'd be cool. We can do that. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. So if you could work on kind of thinking that through, and then next time we meet, we'll talk about those different goals and maybe ways to make some small changes in that relationship to to meet those goals. \"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"I am I'm I feel now that that I can't come to any solution with the problems and he's been drinking a lot and and He always enjoyed a social drink when when we first got married, but I'm noticing now that he's drinking more and more, he seems to be drinking most days of the week. And when he does drink, he's very, very difficult to talk to.\", \"completion\": \"So the alcohol seems to be a problem. Do you think that might be relating to the changing behavior that you mentioned earlier?\"}\n",

He's very, very easy to to make angry over the smallest of things. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. So that must be difficult for you and the children. How have you noticed if the children have picked up on the change in his behavior?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, he does have a very good relationship with the children and he actively participates in their in their daily lives and the children haven't mentioned anything to me and they don't seem to have changed their behavior in any way, the arguments don't tend to happen in front of the children either. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. Are the arguments, something that is it over more trivial things? Or does it sort of other big key things that you're kind of arguing with him about?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, the arguments can start over something small, can be just a simple argument over a task in the house that can escalate into an argument about his family or about my mother or about money issues, and it just seems to escalate out of control. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. So Julie, have you in terms of his drinking, I'm kind of just trying to ascertain maybe what has developed in in your marriage that's taking you to the point that potentially you know, you've come to see me today.

      "{\"prompt\": \"I have. I've tried to talk to him about the drinking a couple of times, and he just gets very, very defensive with me.\", \"completion\": \"Potentially, he's not acknowledging then that he may have a drinking problem. \"}\n",

And I'm pleased that you've come here today to try to, you know, work through some of these issues. Now, Julie, in terms of, I guess, your commitment to the marriage in terms of where you want the marriage, kind of To go, do you think that you have a strong base that you can potentially, you know, if we were able to help your husband with the drinking side of things that it might your marriage itself might be strong enough to overcome and to move forward in the relationship Or, you know, tell me a little bit about what your thoughts are with that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I'm hopeful that we could resolve the issues that we're having and although at the moment, I feel like I need a break away from him. If he was able to get the support that he needed, and we were able to get the support together.

Julie, in terms of your own support, you mentioned your mom's looking after the children today, do you would you consider yourself to have friends and family that you know, have you spoken to anyone else about this issue?\"}\n",

I have sisters who live in Sydney, and also my mom. So they're all around me. And they're very, very caring towards me.\", \"completion\": \"Have any of those note any of the family or friends noticed a change in your husband's behavior?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes, I have actually recently we had a social function and my brother did comment to me on how much alcohol my husband consumed at this some social event. \", \"completion\": \"Okay, so this is impacting on you, as well as the, I guess, the extended family as well. Well, it's really good to hear that you do have a support network outside of this room, I guess, which is really, really good and it's great that you've got that and I'd encourage you to use your mom and your family and friends, you know, as a gentle ear to listen to, you know, to help you support yourself and the children through this, this phase or this stage in your relationship with your husband. So, Julie, I'm just trying to think about potentially you, just to recap, So you're saying that your relationship with your husband has changed from what it was. You've been with him for about eight years, and you have got three children. You've mentioned that the primary changes his behavior, and that you believe that it probably is linked to his changing drinking habits. And from what I understand you've expressed that you would be happy to potentially work with him to resolve or seek help for him in relation to his drinking habits. How do you would that be right what I've said?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes, that's right. That's correct. I would be happy to work on things if he was willing to do that as well.\", \"completion\": \"Not knowing your husband, I guess I would probably need to ask you if Do you think that your husband would be receptive to Maybe some marriage counseling or going to see somebody about his drinking. Is he the type of person that might be receptive to that? Or\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I think he would I think if I was able to approach him when he was calm and relaxed, I think that yes, he probably will be receptive to that. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. That's positive. That's really good. Because some people that I meet, you know that the answer to that would be quite different. So I think that's really positive for you, Julie. I think what we probably need to look at now is is maybe continuing this relationship between you and I. So I'd love to see you again and meet up with you again, but also to I think we probably need to explore that avenue of, of either getting you some marriage counseling or something along those lines, as well as seeing whether or not your husband might be interested in in looking at some services to help him with his his drinking issues that he has So if it's okay by you, what we might do from here is organized for us to meet again. What time is best for you?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Around this time is a good is a good time for me and any Thursday or Friday during during the day is good.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so what we'll do is we'll we'll organize maybe for this time next week, and we'll meet again, but in the meantime, I think we probably need to put you in contact with the relationships counselor. And we'll try to get that side of things going. And as a result of that, we'll be able to work out how receptive Your husband is of, of potentially seeking some help for him as well. I would like to just say that you mentioned that you you probably would like to escape a little bit from it at the moment. So perhaps I might be able to give you some advice or some some information on you know, some things that you might be able to do to take yourself away from that situation, if you feel as if you know, it's a little bit too much, maybe you might like to tap into your mom or your family and friends as well, if you don't feel comfortable using some of the other services in the area. How do you feel about that?\"}\n",

And then I thought, you know, I should probably go to the store because we're almost out of milk. And, you know, and I think the boys need shampoo, but I just, I just sat down and I just sat there and I think I sat for I don't even know how long the boys came home from school. It was like, you know, 330 and I hadn't even gotten up. And so then I said, Okay, the boys are home. I should probably get started on dinner soon, because my husband will be home soon. And I found I found something in the fridge to make and I made dinner and you know, after that everybody, you know, just sat down, we just watch TV and I just sat there until it was time to go to bed.\", \"completion\": \"This is you said this was recently right?\"}\n",

You know, I could make sure that everything that they had everything they needed, I could pay for lunches and get the boys dressed and you know, check they needed any permission slip sign, that kind of thing. Send them out the door and then I would see if we needed anything from the store. I probably do a little bit of cleaning around the house. I used to like have like a list of chores that like I would do different things on different days and different days of the month and stuff. So like bedding would get washed one day in the week and that kind of thing. So I would probably like follow that list. Nowadays I just, you know if it gets done, it gets done and usually my husband helps me with some of the stuff and you know, I would do the bathrooms one day a week that probably gets done like once a month now. But um, I would do that so do the cleaning. If we if I needed to go to the story we do that. I get ready for the boys to come home I'd probably make them a snack and and figure out what was going to be for dinner, I would go ahead and do that. And then probably, you know, sometimes we we would watch TV after my husband got home after dinner or I would figure out something for us to do, we could play a board game or or watch a movie as a family or something like that. And that would be after the kids did their homework and everything like that. And then after we spent some time together, I put them in a bed.\", \"completion\": \"Alright, so it's a fairly wide discrepancy between where you are in terms of behavior and where you want to be. So let me ask you a very specific question about one of the first things in the day you would mention that when it was time to get up. Right? You did. So you were awake and aware of it, but you went back to sleep. And, of course, your husband got up and he took care of things. \"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"I just like, you know, the alarm goes off, and I know it's time to get up and my husband's getting out of bed and I just look at the clock and I think, what's the point and, you know, it's just this instant feeling of I can't even describe it like pointlessness of getting up. And so, I go back to sleep, but I feel worse for doing it. You know, like, it's a catch 22 like, I don't want to wake up, I just don't want to, but then when I go back to sleep, I feel bad. I feel guilty. \", \"completion\": \"Okay, so I'm not getting up in the time you wanted you feel guilty, but you also mentioned something that you thought, which was, if I'm not mistaken, you said what's the point, can you expand on that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"It just it's just like, you know, when I'm sleeping, I don't realize how sad I am. And I don't realize how hard it is to function. When I'm sleeping.

And so I just have this feeling of like, what's the point of getting up and experiencing these feelings when I could go back to sleep and not have to\", \"completion\": \"What's the point of getting up when sleeping pain at back?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yes, yeah. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. But then, when you when you do get up, you feel sad and guilty about having overslept.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.\", \"completion\": \"So really, functionally, what you're doing is you're delaying experiencing the pain.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah\", \"completion\": \"And then in terms of how it affects your relationships and your family, you're not getting your kids off to school. Your husband's getting real frustrated. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah\", \"completion\": \"And all you've really bought yourself is a couple extra hours sleep. And you know, presumably without without pain because you're sleeping, but you're not really escaping it. Does that make sense? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Before when you felt more satisfaction and purpose, did you get up and help the kids off to school?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, it was so easy. I would just like, you know, I would wake up and, and I would be like, Okay, it's time to get up and get out of bed and get ready to go. I mean, you know, sometimes if, if, if I was a little bit tired, it would be a little bit harder. You know, it's not, you know, as a stay at home mom, I usually get enough sleep for the most part now that the kids are older and everything, so it's not usually too hard to get up and I would, I would, you know, it would be another good day, you know, I would be glad to get up and take care of the things that I needed to take care of and I felt accomplished.\", \"completion\": \"So maybe what's going on here? Or maybe maybe we could help you remember, you know, over the last few sessions, we've talked about cognitive behavioral therapy and different techniques that I'll be using and different things we're talking about, sometimes with behavior, the behavior that's useful, which in this case, I'm assuming we can agree is the getting up on time. behavior that's useful has to come first, even if the feeling doesn't match. Right. So sleeping those extra I presume you a couple hours delays you from feeling sad, but it causes other problems. If you were to get up one time, you might still feel sad, right? Because that's why you're over sleeping, as you're sleeping longer to avoid that. But the functional part of being a housewife, as you identify would be completed. So maybe some of those feelings of sadness and guilt would over time abate. Because functionally speaking, you're completing the tasks that you want. What's tough about that, So in the moment, it's easy for me to say this now. But in the moment, like for instance, when you have to get out of bed tomorrow, you're going to be facing that same challenge, which is I can get up now and feel depressed, or I can wait and feel depressed later. So in that moment, it's hard to act on the behavior that you kind of know you want to move towards. I mean, it sounds like you want to get up and \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah, I mean, I want everything to be normal again. And I guess I never really thought of it like that. Like, I just thought, Well, if I'm waking up at the right time, and I'm just feeling bad then like, like I said, What's the point, but I guess it makes sense. Like, even if I don't feel like doing it, maybe it'll make me feel better if I do do it, even if it's hard, because nothing is really harder than when I'm already going through.\", \"completion\": \"Well, it seems like you're, you're more or less making things worse, right? In an effort to avoid the pain that you're going to suffer anyway. You're making the pain worse, and just delaying it a little bit, right. What what thought and we talked before about automatic thoughts, these thoughts that come up when your belief system meets these different situations that occur when you have the thought that this is pointless. Right, and I'm going to expand on my thought a little and say that, you know that thoughts really getting at is I can avoid this pain if I sleep a little while longer. That's a version of the thought.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Does that make sense? And also, I guess I thought that, no, it wouldn't really be that beneficial to get up. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. So minimizing the benefit.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So there's a couple of things going on, right? I can avoid the pain by slipping in. And there's really no point to getting out because I won't do any good anyway. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"What adaptive response is that self talk, we talked about those things we consciously think to ourselves, could you apply in that moment when you're, you know, whatever time you get up in the morning, when you're thinking about this, that thought comes in that it doesn't really matter if I get up anyway.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, I guess I could tell myself like I can do this. Like Instead of, you know, when I say to myself, what's the point instead I can say, I can do this? I can get out of it. It'll be okay. I can. I'm strong enough, even though it's hard to push through the pain and get up now, even though I don't want to, I can say I can do this. \", \"completion\": \"Okay. So that would be adaptive response. I'm strong enough. I can get through this, but it will be difficult. Right? How about the value of getting up early and seeing the kids off to school. The automatic thought right now is telling you that's not valuable. But I think that you believe it is valuable.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I mean, I know it's valuable. I guess what my frustration is, is that I know it's valuable and it used to give me like an emotional payoff of like, pride and, and satisfaction and now I'm not getting that anymore. So I guess I need to realize that even though I'm not getting it right now. If I keep trying, maybe it will happen again, because it did happen before,\", \"completion\": \"it will seem logical that you have higher probability of getting that back. If you do get up, then if you guess that's true, right? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"So never get the satisfaction of sending my kids off to school by never send my kids off to school,\", \"completion\": \"she had a zero percent chance of successful successfully moving past this was asleep again and you have some other probability greater than zero if you if you do.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I never thought about it like that.\", \"completion\": \"That kind of makes sense?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So even though getting up early is going to be painful and seem like not a practical move. Logically, you know, that has a better chance of paying off for you and I think that with with these type of, what you're going through is probably depression. Right now what I like to talk to you further, to make sure that's what's going on seems like you're depressed, and sometimes with depression, you just have to get one thing going your way each day. Right? So, so I'm not saying necessarily tomorrow, you have to get up one time, and then go make new friends and then go find social activities, right? You don't have to build Rome in a day here. Right? It's, it's more like, Can I do this one thing? Okay, I proved to myself, just what I'm saying, which is I'm strong enough to get up. See the kids often have that one victory for tomorrow. Right and build on that. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"And part of that's going to be playing those adaptive responses back, right thinking of those thoughts. Whether it's just thinking them, you know, in your mind or actually thinking them and saying, sometimes it's helpful just to say them out loud,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Not letting the negative thoughts take over because that's what I'm thinking like, okay, I can get the kids off to school, but after that, I'm going to start thinking You know, what's the point again? Like, what? Why don't I just sit down, there's just no point. So if I can keep reminding myself that I just have to try, and that I did accomplish something, and then, you know, even though it's hard, and I know that those thoughts are going to come back, and then I'm going to feel bad. If I don't do anything, I'm not going to feel any better.\", \"completion\": \"So you have a good handle on the adaptive responses sounds like right. And you know what you have to say after but you know, what you want to do. I'll see again in a week, and there'll be five days in there between now and my see again, we will have to decide they want to get up as your kids off to school or not, right. So I want you to give that a tryto adaptive responses and try to push through with that behavior. Now it's important to keep in mind that we have five days between now I want to see you again in five business days, right? school days, and you may not succeed every day. And that's okay.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, maybe. I mean, those guilty feelings really suck.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut out your locker. what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, cuz she's stupid.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day. You said he hadn't called. He hadn't been texting us. And that was on your mind?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, Only if I am in the mood to cut it's tempting\", \"completion\": \"having that pencil is going to make it harder to try other things. When you've been talking about how you're really committed to not cutting any more or cutting less\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, I am.\", \"completion\": \"Sounds like that pencils standing in your way.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, maybe.\", \"completion\": \"What do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time, choosing a different favorite pencil that maybe you can't cut with. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, maybe only, only if it's can be like a really cool pencil\", \"completion\": \"That way you can still have something that can be your favorite but which won't tempt you. That'll make it easier to try the two things.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, what do you think our first thing should be? What do you think you can try? You just heard somebody say something you don't want to hear you're feeling pretty angry. What can you do in that moment?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh, what I do a lot at home when my mom's bothering me and saying stuff I don't want to hear I put my headphones on.\", \"completion\": \"Do you have your headphones with you at  school?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"I think so. there's a there's a few songs that usually helped me so I think so.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, that sounds like a good one to try. So we have headphones, we need to come up with One more. What do you think you'd like to try?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I really like my teacher, Mrs. Xion. So she seems to always kind of be there when I need to talk. And her rooms kind of right down the hallway from my locker than the same hallway. So I guess I could talk to her. \", \"completion\": \"That sounds like a good option. That's our goal is to keep pushing, cutting further down the list, and keep adding things that you're going to try first. And you're right that the first thing you try, it might not bring you all the way down to a two or three, but it might bring you down a little bit. And each thing you try might bring you down just a little bit more. So you have to be willing to try a few things. Can you do that?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I can, but I really want like a cooler pencil though, like, like a cooler pencil, so I don't know, maybe, maybe we could go look for a pencil together.\", \"completion\": \"I think that's a good idea.\"}\n",

So staying low, and close on course, for first I know she's coming up to my final exams, and a lot of us as a few exams. And so I just started working really hard. I felt like right now is the real time to put the effort in and to put the work in. So I started to step a bit later and take on a bit more work. So my stress levels sort of start to increase over a while. I was drinking a lot more coffee took few caffeine tablets and energy drinks. A few people were because some of the environment at the time was a lot of people were pushing themselves that they wouldn't normally do and some people were taking Ritalin.\", \"completion\": \"Okay.\"}\n",

Yeah, and so I was I was relishing it I was doing a lot work and\", \"completion\": \"so did that mean to you then to be at that time it sounds like you put quite a lot of pressure on yourself you've been doing really well at uni and and you know, this was it This was the time.

I didn't wasn't really part of my life at the time. I didn't really talk to any of my friends about it. But then I yeah, I started to just sort of grow into it. And I took the opportunity to Yeah, enjoy this time and it's so it didn't really reach its peak until after my exams I was still. I was still functioning throughout my exams, and I have since found out that I didn't get the results that I wanted to.\", \"completion\": \"and what you might think that was?\"}\n",

And yeah, I just thought to grow even further. So I mentioned I was I was taking Ritalin to block coffee and as soon as our exams had stopped, I just substance abuse of took a bit more of a hold.

But you don't do that. You know, to make yourself not do the ritual.

One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking. So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way.

So you'll shoot for hire full time, but you realize that you kind of need to know what the minimum is because you know what job offer you could accept in which I want free time to decline. Right?

Right? So statistics probability is on your side here. Right? So, as you go out to the workplace and the workforce and seek employment, you'll probably have some, some interviews, we don't get a job offers, right.

Well, you do have two adaptive responses I want you to apply when those automatic thoughts come up, like, I'm never gonna work again. Okay, this is a catastrophe. So like that self talk. Yeah, apply that self talk. So identify that automatic thought, because we've talked about that skill, right? And then apply that self talk right away. All right, and let's see, you have the thought record. Right. So when that you know, when you can fill one of those out, okay, when that happens when you have that automatic thought and you apply the adaptive response, even if you can't get it completely filled out, I understand that.

So, I'd like that to be one of the, you know, if you're okay with it, that'd be one homework steps, and the other one. So just just be two things for this week. So that self talk in the morning, and the other one was, is really just starting to cultivate an awareness in the day of when you're having these automatic thoughts.

So that's not an easy request, satisfied to starting out with just try to bring up an awareness of that. If you can, I think super helpful, the best way is to write it down, if it's safe to do so.

Do you feel motivated to take some steps toward it?\"}\n",

Yeah, I mean, I could maybe quit, especially the house to get the job, especially.\", \"completion\": \"So with anxiety reduction, your chances of stopping marijuana increase, and then you could take the job that you want\"}\n",

I could, yeah, I'm just going to have a cigarette.\", \"completion\": \"So here's what I'm thinking. And let me know what you think about this. When you come back next week, right? What if we start looking at this anxiety? When we start, you know, I start treating anxiety. We'll see if we can get it reduced. And kind of work from there.

I want you to actually watch your mind go as it constructs those scary futures and just notice it. Like, sort of like the way you carry something that's fragile. wants you to just to set a notice.

Okay, what's the chances of you being stranded out there on highway and even if you were stranded, is there a way you could cope with that or manage that you can get back home?

So we'll have some, try to build some skills to manage your emotions. And then on this behavior side, one thing that we might begin to work on is helping you gradually begin to take on some of these driving things so that you can build your confidence back up.

And, yeah, caught up a little bit and kind of talked about some things.\", \"completion\": \"Great. Yeah. Oh, nice. Nice. happy to hear about that. And then I don't remember I'm trying to think from last time, like any Allen updates or Yeah, nice things going, Okay, good. I'm happy to hear that. And then I guess the other thing that I wanted to, you know, talk with you about I know that we, you know, kind of had mentioned it briefly. But today kind of marks the kind of beginning of that kind of final phase for us like so then over the next, you know, three sessions, we're going to be starting to kind of wrap up our work together. And I've been feeling that way too, because it's like, it's hard to, it's hard to want to bring that up, because it's really, it's been really just great working with you. And so I really don't want to see that come to an end. But I thought one of the things that's really important is maybe just to get us starting to talk about and again, we don't have to do it all today but just at least get a starting to talk about, you know, some of the changes that you've made, things that have gone really well for you. And really maybe kind of recap like how it is that you've gone from like almost like binge eating daily to almost now you're not at all and kind of, maybe we can kind of talk about how that's gone. Because I think the other thing that's really important is not only the things that you've done in terms of like, how things have gotten better for you, but I also want us to start thinking about to like, okay, what's going to happen when we, you know, kind of get to the end of our work together and, you know, beyond so like in terms of like, how will kind of how you will kind of keep the work going. And so, I've kind of thought, you know, like, I feel like, I'm kind of being like a wet blanket here. You've had a really great week, and now I'm bringing up our kind of departure. But I think it's really important to kind of mark that mark that transition, and also to market to by having, you know, things go so well. I think it's really important. So I guess the first thing I want to talk about is, I guess I'm pointing my my pad of paper because it's like it's so filled with just all the different things that have occurred for you, you know, over the last several weeks, and I think the first thing that's really notable to me is I really, really appreciated your willingness to engage your mom because I know that that's been so hard for you. And it's been so painful, you know, the way that she's treated you in the past. But that you know, I guess I'm even getting kind of emotional talking about because it just been so rich, the transition you've made in terms of the way you've engaged in a more genuine way and allowed her kind of back into your life and it seems like that that's been, you know, really vital to your you know, like getting better.  So what what's you know, in terms of like, from your perspective, kind of what's that been like for you? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. It's kind of emotionally and it feels good. It's nice not butting heads with her cuz\", \"completion\": \"I'm sure like, \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"you want like, I want a good relationship with my mom. I don't I don't choose purposefully to not have a good relationship with her. Yeah, it feels really good. I feel like I can have better relationships, other places as well now because that's healthy.\", \"completion\": \"Right. Right money. And also to I think along with that, is that kind of the strategies, I think that you've, you know, my hunch would be is that some of the strategies that you've used, engage your mom in a more meaningful way have really kind of come in handy in some respects in terms of like, some of the other relationships that you've had, you know, especially, I know that you and Kathy have gotten closer, and even the fact that you've allowed yourself to kind of, you know, connect with somebody else, like, you know, with Alan, you know, I know you were talking with me the other day about some other friends that you've, you know, met and people that you've really got a little bit closer to so that's been really exciting. Yeah,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah. Yeah. Just get to not go home and feel terrible. Right.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. Yeah. So then, then, kind of from, from your perspective, again, you know, we'll talk more about this in, you know, as you mean, I realize I'm kind of putting you on the spot, but as you've kind of thought about or thinking about it. Maybe you can think about it. To even from now on to the next couple of sessions, but just starting to think about like, what is it that you've really done that you really feel like has been really, that's really helped you make changes in the way in which you've, you know, managed your food or your binge eating.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, just really trying to be more positive in my relationships and being more open and communicating, not keeping things in Sofia, like, when I kept things in it kind of bubble up. And that's what made me want to do something that made me feel better. And I yeah, I mean, like, something bothers me, like, immediately express it,\", \"completion\": \"bro. No, I've noticed that as well. And it seems like that that's been one of the important things that you've done. It's really helped, you know, with the changes that you've made. What else feels like that? I mean, you know, I mean, obviously, that's been really important, but what are the other things that you've noticed in terms of like, you know, how it's been going\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I feel better about myself. And, like not having comments from my mom anymore and having a guy in my life who really likes how I love. Yeah. And yeah, just yet feeling happier with myself.\", \"completion\": \"grades are good. No, you know, things like, like we're really in a good space. And I think the other thing too, I was aware of that we, you know, that you'd mentioned to me in particular last time was that and I didn't get a chance to talk with you as much about it. So I think we had so much to talk about last session, but I was really struck by the fact that you It seems like you haven't been as body conscious as you have been in the past. And I didn't know if you've if you've noticed that.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, no, I feel like I've known like a little bit. Notice that Yeah. Especially that you bring it up. It's true,\", \"completion\": \"right? Yeah. Cuz I know like initially and even like, there have been times even along the way. When you'll make, like, you know, I didn't feel like it looked very good, or I felt like something felt really tight on me or, you know, I just felt like that other people were looking at me or maybe judging me, but it seems like that, that as we've kind of moved along that there's really been I've really noticed a real kind of a little bit of a shift in the way in which you've kind of been regarding yourself. And it seems like it's been a little bit different\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"in that hearing, like, any comments, all my mom about any of that stuff, right. I feel like I've gotten to the point where I'm not concerned like that. I'm going to hear a comment. Right.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, but so I'm going to go ahead and make you talk about it anyway. But what did you do in order to be able to get those comments, though, to stop? Because obviously, I think you did something really significant with her. Yes.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, I thought about what you said about really acknowledging that that put a lot of pain on me and Justin Lee, and I know I was able to let her know that and is hired scared to tell her that I mean, she recognized that. Yeah. And yeah, she kind of explained how she thought that she was helping me or she wanted me to have a lot of friends in high school. And that's what she, I mean, she kind of said, like her mom said the same thing to her.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, and that's really not uncommon when you have, you know, it's funny that just even like, not, you know, like, big, big research had, but it seems like that that's pretty consistent, that, you know, kind of, like, you know, mothers to daughters who become mothers to daughters, like sometimes it's kind of what we call this intergenerational transmission of like, you know, kind of criticality about, you know, shape and weight and, and, you know, some, you know, really proud of you that you, you know, kind of had the courage to address it with her directly and just let her know how you feel because, you know, I think, you know, as a parent, I know that you owe it Like, you know, I always want to try to do the right thing, you know, and I always, you know, I don't purposely want to inflict pain on my children, even though my daughters would suggest that I probably do. But in general, I don't. That's not my goal is to be, you know, harsh and critical. In fact, I really was, you know, try to really be helpful. And I think most parents try to do the right thing. But I, and I think maybe your mom just didn't realize the degree to which that really bothered you and how much that hurt. And in many respects, how much that kind of really drove you to, you know, really, you know, take it out on yourself, so to speak. And so for you to have the courage to bring that up, I think was really helpful. Yeah, yeah. So I really think that that made a lot of differences, as well as, you know, kind of reaching out to others and again, in just the open expression of your feelings, so yeah. So yeah, I think the things that we're doing like now, I think I'd really like to see us kind of continue to, you know, obviously, you still are doing a lot of really good work in terms of like the things that you're talking about and, but yet, I'm also aware that you know, as we're over the next couple sessions, we kind of keep doing a few of these things kind of wrapping up. And then our last session we can more or less, kind of formally, you know, say goodbye and talk about kind of like what the next steps are and, you know, some things you might want to be paying attention to or things you might want to, you know, be mindful of, but we'll get there so yeah. \"}\n",

And I think that was probably a really short sighted thing of me to do so.\", \"completion\": \"Because you went at the wrong time. I'm sorry to hear that.

It's just so much responsible. And I guess, I guess before I felt like I could handle it. And now I just feel like it's so much responsibility for one person.

So, in CBT, we like to evaluate evidence and try to look at the facts as we understand them.

So that's like a really dangerous situation for kids to be in, because you don't know what kind of people are coming in and out of the home, if their parents are going to be, you know, coherent enough to help them if there's an emergency or if the parents are even making them food and taking care of their needs and stuff like that. So I guess in that sense, that's really concerning.

I am so I don't know if it's scared, or worried or maybe a combination of everything. And I'm just like sweating. My heart is racing. Like I almost feel dizzy. I'm just so stressed out about what's going to happen. And then you know, I'm starting to speak. And then the presentations are usually like 20 minutes or so. Okay, so I have to stay up there for the duration and I'm just like, you know, sweating and then I'm wondering like, are people looking at me or people? Can people see it? You know, am I going to forget something?\", \"completion\": \"So the some of the thoughts are you wonder if they can see how anxious you are you wonder if you're gonna do poorly on the presentation,\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Right. Or like be judging me. Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Yeah. So there's a number of concerns that kind of going through your mind in that moment. So when does this start to turn around so you start presenting is 20 minutes you initially get up there and get your presentation up on the The projection monitor. Yeah. When does it start to turn the corner?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Um, it's depends sometimes I settled down a little bit, but then usually like that, I get some sort of rhythm I think. And then, but then it gets anxiety again until I get my grades. Do you know what I mean? And I'm like, until, because I feel like I'm gonna do poorly.

      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, when eyes are maybe no longer on me. They've moved on to somebody else. So I figured like, okay, they forgot about me. I'm safe.\", \"completion\": \"All right, then. But then there's this other worry of now we have to see what the grades are right?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"I'm pretty good. How are you Dr. Grande ?\", \"completion\": \"I'm doing I'm doing well thanks for asking. What's been going on?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Um, so I've, I've been applying to doctor programs for this upcoming fall. And I'm like, I'm kind of stuck because I got into two of the schools that that I was looking at. I get and like I got into both of them and both of their programs are really good. Both of them have like great research track records and kind of what I want to do. \", \"completion\": \"Right\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"And yeah, but the problem is is like I don't know how to decide between the two now.\", \"completion\": \"Okay, So you, you applied to two places, and you got them both. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Hmm\", \"completion\": \"It sounds like both have programs that are really well suited to what you want to do?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"And you're having difficulty deciding which one to go with.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Um, yeah, like I've always I've always had trouble, like, within decisiveness and it's like, when I, when I had two choices of something that's very similar, like I always I always get stuck. And I like, it's very hard for me to actually like make a decision\", \"completion\": \"Let's are start to the beginning. You definitely want to go on for a PhD. Okay, so we've established that\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right.\", \"completion\": \"So it's going to be one of these programs either way. So really, the only question you're really left with is which one? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So oftentimes, these situations we look at pros and cons, right? Are there any? Well, it sounds like there's a lot of pros to each one. Are there any cons to the one ?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, really not, not any that I can think of like, I've tried to, like, I've tried to write them down the piece of paper, do the pros and cons and like the pros look very close. And it's like the same number, but I mean, both programs are good. I have connections with like the some of the teachers and both of them. They're both in the same city. Like they're really close to each other. They're, they're both very similar, but like, for some reason, I just, I don't know, it would be easier if there's like some cons to one of them\", \"completion\": \"It will make the decision easier if you had some negatives that for one of the programs\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right\", \"completion\": \"there for the other one. So in a way, you know, I guess this we call quote unquote, good problem\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right\", \"completion\": \"It's a problem, but you're choosing between two alternatives that are both really positive for you, but it's there is a choice, right? It's still tough. And you mentioned before that you had some, in your past you're indecisive. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"So maybe we can do in this process is help you build decision making skills or contribute to that ability. Because whichever whichever program you get into where you choose, you're gonna have to make decisions later on to \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right\", \"completion\": \"and probably vary, or maybe some of those will be easier, maybe some of those choices won't be as easy. So I think this would be a matter of looking at what's important to you. But you mentioned the research agenda already, or agendas at both universities, that's important, too\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right\", \"completion\": \"What are the aspects and maybe not so much thinking about these two universities, but in general, if you had to rank order them, what aspects are really the most important?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Um, well, definitely, the research is up there. I definitely want to get that out of out of whichever school I go to. I think something else that's important is for the university to have kind of like maybe a post doctorate plan, whether they have connections with, like businesses where I can get a job like right after graduate or, like if I was going to move into a faculty position, like if they kind of had a pathway that would help set me up for that like that. Those are probably the biggest, like the biggest influencers,\", \"completion\": \"The research and not a guarantee, necessarily, but some high probability employment?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right.\", \"completion\": \"So really what we could do here, if you want to look at these two universities, even though we don't really have any negatives to look at, we can rank these positives. So it sounds like both have the research that you're looking for that \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"bright\", \"completion\": \"they're both there. But if you could rank and maybe you don't have this information right now, but if you could rank them in terms of the next most important aspect, which is really how hard Will you work to find a job? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right\", \"completion\": \"That's, that's kind of what you're saying. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay, right. \", \"completion\": \"I mean, it sounds like what you're saying?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right\", \"completion\": \"So, do you have any information? Or is that something you can find?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Um, actually, that's I never thought about like that. Like, I guess I could go online and kind of look at a lot of times universities put up like job acceptance rates like afterwards and they put up percentages, kind of like what what people do afterwards. So maybe if I looked at the websites and kind of found information and see like, how many of them go on to be professors or like work in the industry, maybe maybe I should check that out. That might help me\", \"completion\": \"that might allow you to have a difference between them because right now, it's like they're just kind of, they're kind of melded together\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right\", \"completion\": \"You know, you have you have really no way yet to separate them\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right.\", \"completion\": \"So maybe this can build a bit of a discrepancy that the gap between them so you can say, Okay, this one, neither one is bad, right? But this one might be a little better for what I want to do. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Does that does that kind of make sense?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Similarly, as the I think about it, I know whenever I leave speaking with somebody or some situation, that's right, I always think of all the questions I want to ask, right. So when you leave here, you can consider some of the other aspects and like, Think it over like really important to me and try to create that distance between them. So you can look at them as really two separate entities. Another possibility would be to find out this information, maybe talking to representatives from each university. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay\", \"completion\": \"If they may or may not have more information about potential pros and they might even have some cons right now. I'm sure they'll present a plate manner but they can let you know maybe some of the negatives.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"Associated With the other university, or maybe some of the positives that aren't quite as positive\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right, right, \", \"completion\": \"something that they do well with others, other university doesn't do as well. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"So it sounds like this information gathering would really be your next step.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Yeah. Yeah. I never actually thought about ranking the the pros and going from there. So I think that's a good idea. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"One of the things that might be helpful to drive is the importance you place on these different aspects, right. So kind of clarify, and we can we meet again, we'll talk about this, but clarify your values and what's important to you. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Okay.\", \"completion\": \"And then that'll help you to kind of rank some of these attributes.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. \", \"completion\": \"All right. Let's, let's leave it there. And we'll kind of pick up next time with looking at what we talked about. Unless you have any further questions.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"No, no, I think, yeah, I think I know what I can do afterwards, no we decided.\", \"completion\": \"So I'll see you in about a week and we'll pick up there\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"I can't control her. I don't know how she would react and I just don't want any more arguments and anger. And yeah, I don't want to hurt her. So.\", \"completion\": \"So when you think about taking this break, you're also thinking about how she might respond and what she might do and that creates this whole other kind of set of worries. It, it undermines your sense of confidence onon some level.\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"because I know if I just let it drag out that I'm going to be miserable.\", \"completion\": \"So your sense of readiness is actually really connected to your motivation that is that this is something you know, that you need to do for yourself.

And things were great for a while you had some hope that things were going to change and now you are realizing that Kelly's not going to change and that you are suffering in the process that you are really being kept from your aspirations and your dreams, in a lot of different regards. You know, that you need to make a change, you want to make a change, and you have a lot of mixed feelings about this change. You know, it's what you want to do, it's the right thing for you. And you still really care and love, Kelly. And you're also concerned, kind of on an outer level, about your business, about your community, about your family and your friends and how they may be affected by a breakup. In order to make this more manageable, you're thinking maybe in terms of smaller change, like taking a small break, as opposed to breaking off the relationship and you feel like you're pretty ready. You're somewhat You know, you're motivated. And then maybe a little less confident.

So I got pulled over for that and then I don't know why I did this but the cop asked to search my car and I was like, yeah, that's fine like whatever because he said he had two searches. This is getting towed. And I completely forgot that I had my junk bag in the trunk. So we opened the trunk and he was looking through the bag. So he found me he found everything. I had my weed in there at the bottom the pipe like all my pieces. So I got a, I got in trouble for possession. So I just I just want him to court and the judge offered me this decision. He said that I could either do two weeks of community service like about 80 hours, or I could pay $1,000 fine. And I'm trying to I'm really trying to figure out which one really which one would be better I guess, the both kind of suck but\", \"completion\": \"So you're struggling with the decision between two options you perceived as negative, right. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"Now we've discussed the marijuana usage before was just probably the root of this problem. Right?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"No, I mean, it's it's really not a problem like it's just they don't really want it problem is that I got caught like I'm doing good in school works fine.

      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, really, like they both they both have the same negative, I guess like, like if I if I do the community service that I like, you know, I do get to keep the money. But I mean other hand, like if I keep the money, I'm doing community service, like I'm not gonna have all the time to spend the money. So it's now I mean, neither really have a positive and both the negatives are kind of equal to so it's it's kind of tough to choose.\", \"completion\": \"So let's talk about what's important to try to help you make this decision. Really what you're going to have to determine is, and what I want to explore is the importance of keeping the money. Right, because that's really what this comes down to. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"You You keep it and you do the service, or you spend it and you don't do the service?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"So let's talk a little about that. What How would you say on a scale of one to 10, where 10 is very important. How would you scale keeping the money?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I mean, that's obviously pretty high. Like, I guess keeping the money, it'd be like a nine. Because if I, like if I, if I keep the money, obviously, I can, like use it for other other things. I'd say probably nine. \", \"completion\": \"So keeping in mind, that's, that's very important to you. \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right.\", \"completion\": \"So that scenario would be would lean more toward completing the community service.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Right. Yeah, I mean, I guess that's true. Like, I didn't think about it in that way, like if I if I give up the the two weeks of time, like, obviously that would suck, but like I have, I guess I have more of a choice of what to do with money compared to my time. You know, so I guess I could think about it that way maybe\", \"completion\": \"Well, let's look at the other side too. How important is it for you on a scale of one to 10 to avoid the community service? So we know it's a nine, right to keep the money?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Maybe like, I guess maybe about a seven because the like the community service, I mean, it wouldn't be that bad. Obviously, like, it would be a waste of time. We're gonna have to do this crap work for for so long, but I don't know. Like, at least I know if I do the community service and it would be like done after this amount of time. You know, so I can I can always keep that in mind.\", \"completion\": \"So, as you're talking, it seems like you're leaning toward or maybe you're leaning toward completing the service. Even though you're not happy with either choice, right?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"on Friday, yeah. When I get the decision.\", \"completion\": \"Once you weigh some of the factors with the way this importance of the money versus doing the community service\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"right\", \"completion\": \"let's meet again just before maybe on Thursday. Okay, let's meet again Thursday. And just talk about it and take a look at your decision making process and making sure that you've made a decision that you can be most happy with. I know neither option is happy option for you. \"}\n",

And then once I'm there, I really just, you know, I go to work and I do what I'm supposed to do, but I try to keep to myself. You know, I don't really enjoy interacting with some of my co workers and\", \"completion\": \"what is it that happens when you try to interact with\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"um, I guess I just, I haven't really connected with any of them and I, I tend to worry about whether I'm doing my job right or if they like me, things like that.

If we have meetings or they ask for my input on input on something, I tend to get nervous and I just wonder, you know, if I'm saying the right thing, and then that sort of makes me get nervous around them.

I mean, obviously, you're here. So it must be some level of distress but how disruptive is it to your functioning?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"I was saying, Yeah, I would say so. Anything where a lot of people are looking at me more than a few, I guess you could say.\", \"completion\": \"Can you tell me a little bit more about the physical symptoms?

You mentioned that you have meetings you have to go to expected. How many people be in a typical meeting?\"}\n",

      "{\"prompt\": \"Mm hmm. And then some happen weekly. Okay.\", \"completion\": \"So for the ones that are planned, you get anxious in advanced welcome.\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, I think about it, as soon as I know, I always know it's coming. So I'm always thinking about, you know, the next meeting that I'll have to present at or how I'll have to contribute.

So the meetings triggered, generally not being isolated in the office kind of triggers this anxiety. Right. But there's other times it sounds like we're not anxious when you're isolating the office. How would have hungry anxious now? \"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"I'm not really when I'm by myself. I don't really feel anxious.\", \"completion\": \"So really, it's when you get up for work and start thinking about the work day, especially if they're meetings, right? That sort of starts to,\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"yeah, like if I have off work for a couple of days, I don't feel anxious at all. It's really just when I'm going to work when I know that I'm going to have to be talking to a lot of people or making presentations, things like that.\", \"completion\": \"So you suffer the anxiety advance of these plan meetings? How about the unplanned meetings? What's your experience of those?\"}\n",
      "{\"prompt\": \"Well, I mean, unplanned meetings, I, I don't really have a lot of time to think about them happening.
